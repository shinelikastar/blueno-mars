All up on TV, I thought it'd make me richer <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wasn't payin' me enough, I needed somethin' quicker <|LINE_BREAK|>
So now I'm all in Niko basement puttin' work in on the phones <|LINE_BREAK|>
Either that or drive to Money Mart to make the pickups <|LINE_BREAK|>
Man, it's 2008, I'm tryna paint the picture <|LINE_BREAK|>
Comeback Season in the works and now I'm thinkin' bigger <|LINE_BREAK|>

Damn, nigga, what's one more quote for us? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, Lord, who else soundin' like this? <|LINE_BREAK|>
They ain't make me what I am, they just found me like this <|LINE_BREAK|>
I was ready... fuck that, I've been ready <|LINE_BREAK|>
Since my dad used to tell me <|LINE_BREAK|>
He was comin' to the house to get me <|LINE_BREAK|>
He ain't show up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Valuable lesson, man, I had to grow up <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I never ask for help <|LINE_BREAK|>

<|VERSE_BREAK|>

Whole squad on that real shit, yeah
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
The other night <|LINE_BREAK|>
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to <|LINE_BREAK|>
She said they love me unconditional <|LINE_BREAK|>
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top <|LINE_BREAK|>
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, okay, from that perspective <|LINE_BREAK|>
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at <|LINE_BREAK|>
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant <|LINE_BREAK|>
They ain't movin' at all <|LINE_BREAK|>
But when they need a favor, who do they call? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems <|LINE_BREAK|>
Askin' what was said and who was involved <|LINE_BREAK|>
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong <|LINE_BREAK|>
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on <|LINE_BREAK|>
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em <|LINE_BREAK|>
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air <|LINE_BREAK|>
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there? <|LINE_BREAK|>
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware <|LINE_BREAK|>
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
We already got spring 2015 poppin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game <|LINE_BREAK|>
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ask yourself, how do we match up now? <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better <|LINE_BREAK|>
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Could it be the way that I'll catch up

Who else really trying to mess with Hollywood Cole <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm with Marley G though <|LINE_BREAK|>
Treating Birmingham just like my Hollywood shows <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm trying to tell you something that you probably should know <|LINE_BREAK|>
This that Slum Dog Millionaire Bollywood flow and uh <|LINE_BREAK|>
My real friends never hearing from me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews <|LINE_BREAK|>
We walk the same path, but got on different shoes <|LINE_BREAK|>
Live in the same building, but we got different views <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos <|LINE_BREAK|>
And these days all the girls are down to roll <|LINE_BREAK|>
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole <|LINE_BREAK|>
I live fast die young, never take it slow <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell your girl to tell a friend that it's time to go <|LINE_BREAK|>
And tell me today's weather <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know they say they good, but trust me I'm better <|LINE_BREAK|>
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater <|LINE_BREAK|>
Really it's whatever <|LINE_BREAK|>
I am murdering and this is so amusing <|LINE_BREAK|>
If they're a sight to see then I am an illusion <|LINE_BREAK|>
I tell you I'm the man baby what is the confusion <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if they still sleeping on me, someone hit the snooze then <|LINE_BREAK|>
And keep sleeping while I sell a couple million <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm about to hit the club, women tell me I'm appealing <|LINE_BREAK|>
But fuck what they say let me tell you how I'm feeling <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm drinking <|LINE_BREAK|>
These London street lamps got a real glow <|LINE_BREAK|>
Dizzy playing driving fast but it feels slow <|LINE_BREAK|>
And ask your man, he a hater, baby, he don't know <|LINE_BREAK|>
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal <|LINE_BREAK|>
This here was meant to get buried <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely <|LINE_BREAK|>
I ain't lying to the kids like the dentist ain't scary <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm what Lebron was to Saint Vincent, Saint Marry <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I ain't playing high school games <|LINE_BREAK|>
Pullin McLarence through a McDonalds drive through lane <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm to fly, I keep it hip hop like Afu-Ra <|LINE_BREAK|>
Baby girl on that Mclaren <|LINE_BREAK|>
You gotta lift the doors <|LINE_BREAK|>
Blades chopping through the city streets, liquid swords <|LINE_BREAK|>
I do it better than the best could <|LINE_BREAK|>
You know what it is, Drake and Tim Westwood

Only you can make me feel the way I feel <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, I'm dying to make you feel like a woman, baby

The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay," and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called "Work." <|LINE_BREAK|>
Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna. <|LINE_BREAK|>
Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since. <|LINE_BREAK|>
When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward. <|LINE_BREAK|>
What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself. <|LINE_BREAK|>
This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one. <|LINE_BREAK|>
She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.

Yeah
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Never thought I'd be talkin' from this perspective <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I'm not really sure what else you expected <|LINE_BREAK|>
When the higher-ups have all come together as a collective <|LINE_BREAK|>
With conspiracies to end my run and send me a message <|LINE_BREAK|>
40, did you get the message? <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause I just checked my phone and I didn't get it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I mean, I'll say hats off for a solid effort <|LINE_BREAK|>
But we didn't flinch for a second, we got our shit together (6) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, not here to fight wars <|LINE_BREAK|>
But niggas wanna talk high scores <|LINE_BREAK|>
PARTY just dipped off in a white Porsche <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I just came from dinner where I ate some well-done seared scallops that were to die for <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I got bigger fish to fry <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm talkin' bigger shit than you and I <|LINE_BREAK|>
Kids are losin' lives, got me scared of losin' mine <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if I hold my tongue about it, I get crucified <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wrote this shit on a bumpy flight on a summer night <|LINE_BREAK|>
Flyin' over Chattanooga, out here tryna spread the movement <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just got me the Mercedes Pullman <|LINE_BREAK|>
You niggas never heard of it, you gotta hit up Google, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back in the city, shit is gettin' brutal <|LINE_BREAK|>
These kids'll hit your noodle, then take a girl to the movies <|LINE_BREAK|>
They been droppin' out on both sides <|LINE_BREAK|>
We ain't in it, we just ghostride <|LINE_BREAK|>
The pen is workin' if you niggas need some ghost lines <|LINE_BREAK|>
I thought you wanted yours like I want mine <|LINE_BREAK|>
I guess you just makin' moves on your own time <|LINE_BREAK|>
But just know it'll be January in no time <|LINE_BREAK|>
And your absence is very concernin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's like you went on vacation with no plan of returnin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shit is purely for sport, I need a 30 for 30 <|LINE_BREAK|>
Banners are ready case we need to retire your jersey, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a club in the Raptors arena <|LINE_BREAK|>
Championship celebrations durin' regular season <|LINE_BREAK|>
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm legally obligated if they request it <|LINE_BREAK|>
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson <|LINE_BREAK|>
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction <|LINE_BREAK|>
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting <|LINE_BREAK|>
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just listened to "Closer to My Dreams" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve <|LINE_BREAK|>
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe <|LINE_BREAK|>
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious <|LINE_BREAK|>
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away <|LINE_BREAK|>
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother <|LINE_BREAK|>
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now you the one gettin' buckets <|LINE_BREAK|>
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches <|LINE_BREAK|>
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to <|LINE_BREAK|>
And women that you seen on TV look better in person <|LINE_BREAK|>
And either they wanna fuck you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but <|LINE_BREAK|>
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action <|LINE_BREAK|>
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually <|LINE_BREAK|>
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened? <|LINE_BREAK|>
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you? <|LINE_BREAK|>
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf <|LINE_BREAK|>
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself <|LINE_BREAK|>
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios <|LINE_BREAK|>
6 G-O-D, I think I <|LINE_BREAK|>
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I. <|LINE_BREAK|>
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doin' macarena <|LINE_BREAK|>
But, who am I to complain now? I'm still around, they know <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah

I'm runnin', but can't run away <|LINE_BREAK|>
You say you changed <|LINE_BREAK|>
But you never change up

<|endoftext|>



<|startoftext|>

Yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
All you self-promoters are janky <|LINE_BREAK|>
We established like the Yankees <|LINE_BREAK|>
This whole fuckin' game thankless <|LINE_BREAK|>
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
No limit to where I can take it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper <|LINE_BREAK|>
I thought we looked out for one another <|LINE_BREAK|>
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble <|LINE_BREAK|>
I guess it's different in the city I come from <|LINE_BREAK|>
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me <|LINE_BREAK|>
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me <|LINE_BREAK|>
The higher I get, the less they accept me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha <|LINE_BREAK|>
No way out 'cause I'm already in it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket <|LINE_BREAK|>
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision <|LINE_BREAK|>
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Even back when I wasn't as poppin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky <|LINE_BREAK|>
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching <|LINE_BREAK|>
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child <|LINE_BREAK|>
Can't nobody hold me down <|LINE_BREAK|>
Especially not right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile <|LINE_BREAK|>
Take that, take that <|LINE_BREAK|>
No love in they heart so they fake that <|LINE_BREAK|>
DiCaprio level the way they play that <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, nigga, what is that? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all don't hear no songs <|LINE_BREAK|>
They hit my phone like, "You did that" <|LINE_BREAK|>
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's always on some shit like <|LINE_BREAK|>
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at <|LINE_BREAK|>
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped <|LINE_BREAK|>
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry <|LINE_BREAK|>
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari <|LINE_BREAK|>
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY <|LINE_BREAK|>
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys <|LINE_BREAK|>
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari <|LINE_BREAK|>
Look, now you got me started <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist <|LINE_BREAK|>
Always gotta play it smarter <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cameras pointing every time I look up <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sponsorship dollars is sky high <|LINE_BREAK|>
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday <|LINE_BREAK|>
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, redoin' the entrance <|LINE_BREAK|>
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
And you still never quite get it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I make you dance to this <|LINE_BREAK|>
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sun shinin', waxed tires <|LINE_BREAK|>
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave <|LINE_BREAK|>
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face <|LINE_BREAK|>
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake <|LINE_BREAK|>
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays <|LINE_BREAK|>
These guys move so greezy nowadays <|LINE_BREAK|>
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Save my stories for down the line <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm too ahead of the curve every time <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Yeah, and we can't stop <|LINE_BREAK|>
Make you dance to this, uh <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'ma make you One Dance to this <|LINE_BREAK|>
A-ha-ha-ha, ha <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bad breed, bad bwoy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Uh-huh, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's right, yeah

<|endoftext|>



<|startoftext|>

Yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
This on some old Tommy Campos Dice Raw shit, you know? <|LINE_BREAK|>
For my niggas, though
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Uh, you underestimated greatly <|LINE_BREAK|>
Most number ones ever, how long did it really take me? <|LINE_BREAK|>
The part I love most is they need me more than they hate me <|LINE_BREAK|>
So they never take shots, I got everybody on safety <|LINE_BREAK|>
I could load every gun with bullets that fire backwards <|LINE_BREAK|>
Probably wouldn't lose a single rapper <|LINE_BREAK|>
Niggas make threats, can't hear 'em over the laughter <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, that's 'cause I'm headed to the bank, nigga <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sinatra lifestyle, I'm just bein' frank with ya <|LINE_BREAK|>
I mean, where you think she at when she ain't with ya? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wildin', doin' shit that's way out of your budget <|LINE_BREAK|>
Owl sweaters inside her luggage, you gotta love it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, this shit could go on a tape <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bitches lovin' my drive, I never give it a break <|LINE_BREAK|>
Give these niggas the look, the verse, and even the hook <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why every song sound like Drake featurin' Drake <|LINE_BREAK|>
Str8, Y pree? Why is it always me? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got us watchin' our words like it's wiretaps on the team <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause I show love, never get the same outta niggas <|LINE_BREAK|>
Guess it's funny how money can make change outta niggas <|LINE_BREAK|>
For real, some nobody started feelin' himself <|LINE_BREAK|>
A couple somebodies started killin' themself <|LINE_BREAK|>
A couple albums dropped, those are still on the shelf <|LINE_BREAK|>
I bet them shits would have popped if I was willin' to help <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a gold trophy from the committee for validation <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bad press during the summer over allegations <|LINE_BREAK|>
I ain't lyin', my nigga, my time is money <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I ain't got time for a nigga whose time is coming <|LINE_BREAK|>
A lot of niggas PR stuntin' like that's the movement <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'm the only nigga still known for the music, I swear <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fuck them niggas this year, I made Forbes list, nigga <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fuck your list, everything's lookin' gorgeous <|LINE_BREAK|>
Without me, rap is just a bunch of orphans <|LINE_BREAK|>
But if I stay, then this shit is a bunch of corpses <|LINE_BREAK|>
And me and my dread nigga from New Orleans <|LINE_BREAK|>
Stashin' money like hoarders off multi-platinum recordings <|LINE_BREAK|>
Eatin' like I’m seated at Swish, Sotto, and Joso's <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nothing Was The Same, this shit for Ezee and Coco <|LINE_BREAK|>
This shit for Karim, this shit for Jaevon <|LINE_BREAK|>
This shit for Julius, Milly Mill, boy, we do this shit for real <|LINE_BREAK|>
All them boys in my will, all them boys is my Wills <|LINE_BREAK|>
Anything happen to pop, then I got you like Uncle Phil <|LINE_BREAK|>
Weezy been on that edge, you niggas just need to chill <|LINE_BREAK|>
If anything happen to Papi, might pop a nigga for real <|LINE_BREAK|>
Comin' live from the screwface, livin' out a suitcase <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I'm feelin' good, Johnny got me pushin' two plates <|LINE_BREAK|>
My weight up, I refused to wait up, I started a new race <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's funny when you think a nigga blew up after Lupe <|LINE_BREAK|>
Niggas treat me like I've been here for 10 <|LINE_BREAK|>
Some niggas been here for a couple, never been here again <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm on my King James shit, I'm tryna win here again <|LINE_BREAK|>
A young nigga tryna win here again, man, what's up?
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Ayy, yeah, a young nigga tryin' to win here again <|LINE_BREAK|>
If I like her, I just fly her to the city I'm in <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got her drinkin' with your boy <|LINE_BREAK|>

Niggas wouldn't make it on this side <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm not new to this, I'm not new, I'm not new <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I know you heard things <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nobody really likes us except for us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, all I ever needed was the squad so that's what's up <|LINE_BREAK|>

Fieri, I'm in the kitchen, I'm a magician <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm on it, I'm like MacGyver, I'm Michael Myers <|LINE_BREAK|>
I kill careers and cut the lights off, this shit is frightenin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I knew it would end up like this, I'm fuckin' psychic <|LINE_BREAK|>
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
(Yeah) Work the night shift <|LINE_BREAK|>
Young, but I'm makin' millions to work the night shift <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Work, work the night shift)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Young but I'm gettin' every single motherfuckin' thing I'm owed <|LINE_BREAK|>
You gotta know <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm here to fuck with nigga's souls, my heart is cold <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's prolly cause I'm from the snow, with all my woes <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know they wanna see me go, I'm on a roll <|LINE_BREAK|>
I mean I'm back on this again, I'm here again <|LINE_BREAK|>
You know the truth, let's not pretend, I'm not your friend <|LINE_BREAK|>
Not your guy, I'm not your buddy, show no lovin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I might go DeMarcus Cousins out in public <|LINE_BREAK|>
Man, I'm back on this again, I'm here again <|LINE_BREAK|>
I didn't do this fuckin' tape for CNN <|LINE_BREAK|>
I am not tryna win awards, that shit looked forced <|LINE_BREAK|>

If you were worried about where <|LINE_BREAK|>
I've been or who I saw or <|LINE_BREAK|>
What club I went to with the homies <|LINE_BREAK|>
Baby don't worry, you know that you got me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I've never worried about where <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm at or who I saw or <|LINE_BREAK|>
What club I go to with the homies <|LINE_BREAK|>
Baby don't worry, I know that they got me

<|endoftext|>



<|startoftext|>

Yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Oh, you gotta love it, oh, you got—oh, you gotta love it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I heard what circulated, let's get to the bottom of it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I told 1da send me something and I got it covered <|LINE_BREAK|>
Somehow I always rise above it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Why you think I got my head in the clouds on my last album cover? <|LINE_BREAK|>
The game is all mine and I'm mighty possessive <|LINE_BREAK|>
Lil Wayne could not have found him a better successor <|LINE_BREAK|>
Every shot you see 'em take at me, they all contested <|LINE_BREAK|>
Allen Iverson shoe deal, these niggas all in question <|LINE_BREAK|>
Last night I went to sleep wanting more <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tryna decide what direction I should go towards <|LINE_BREAK|>
Some nights I wish I could go back in life <|LINE_BREAK|>
Not to change shit, just to feel a couple things twice <|LINE_BREAK|>
28 at midnight, wonder what's next for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Longevity, wonder how long they'll check for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Prolly forever if I stay in my zone <|LINE_BREAK|>
I speak on this generation, but can't change it alone <|LINE_BREAK|>
I heard a lil, lil homie talking reckless in Vibe <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's quite a platform you chose, you should've kept it inside <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, you tried? It's so childish calling my name on the world stage <|LINE_BREAK|>
You need to act your age and not your girl's age <|LINE_BREAK|>
It gets worse by the annual <|LINE_BREAK|>
My career's like a how-to manual, so I guess it's understandable, man <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, you gotta love it, you gotta love it, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know rappers that call paparazzi to come and get 'em <|LINE_BREAK|>
To show they outfits off, guess they need the attention <|LINE_BREAK|>
I remember when it used to be music that did it <|LINE_BREAK|>
But then again times have changed, man, who are we kiddin'? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm managed by my friends that I grew up with <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'd rather give that 15% to people I fuck with <|LINE_BREAK|>
If me and Future hadn't made it with this rappin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
We'd prolly be out in Silicon tryna get our billions on <|LINE_BREAK|>
But here we are, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Lately, I feel the haters eatin' away at my confidence <|LINE_BREAK|>
They scream out my failures and whisper my accomplishments <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bitches alter my messages like we had words <|LINE_BREAK|>
And stories 'bout my life hit the net like a bad serve <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bitter women I'm overtextin' are PMSing <|LINE_BREAK|>
Crazy this year—fuckin' with my image <|LINE_BREAK|>
I've been tryna reach the youth so I can save 'em this year <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fuck it, I guess I gotta wait 'til next year <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I heard someone say something that stuck with me a lot <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Bout how we need protection from those protectin' the block <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nobody lookin' out for nobody <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe we should try and help somebody or be somebody <|LINE_BREAK|>
Instead of bein' somebody that makes the news, so everybody can Tweet about it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And then they start to "R.I.P." about it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And four weeks later nobody even speaks about it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, I just had to say my piece about it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, you gotta love it— <|LINE_BREAK|>
But they scared of the truth so back to me showin' out in public, that's a hotter subject <|LINE_BREAK|>
I been whippin' Mercedes and nigga try to budget <|LINE_BREAK|>
I gotta make it back to Memphis to check on my cousins <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shout out to Ashley, Tasha, Bianca <|LINE_BREAK|>
Julia, Ericka, Southern America <|LINE_BREAK|>
Part of my heritage, pardon my arrogance <|LINE_BREAK|>
Part in my hair again, that's that comeback flow <|LINE_BREAK|>
Comeback flow, once I start it's apparent <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm with a girl who ass is so big that's partly embarrassin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
But fuck all the blushin' and fuck your discussions and fuck all the judgement <|LINE_BREAK|>
Your content so aggressive lately, what's irkin' you? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shit is gettin' so personal in your verses too <|LINE_BREAK|>
I wanna prove that I'm number one over all these niggas <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bein' number two is just being the first to lose <|LINE_BREAK|>
My city dictated music, nobody seein' us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Winter here already, but somehow I'm heatin' up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Been observin' the game and felt like I've seen enough <|LINE_BREAK|>
Let's drop a tape on these niggas, then we'll see wassup <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, boy, you rappin' like you seen it all <|LINE_BREAK|>
You rappin' like the throne should be the three of y'all <|LINE_BREAK|>
"Best I Ever Had" seems like a decade ago <|LINE_BREAK|>
Decadent flow and I still got a decade to go <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh please, take it ease, where's the love and the peace? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Why you rappin' like you come from the streets? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a backyard where money seems to come from the trees <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'm never ever scared to get some blood on my leaves <|LINE_BREAK|>
Phantom slidin' like the shit just hit a puddle of grease <|LINE_BREAK|>
I cook the beef well done on the double with cheese <|LINE_BREAK|>
Special order for anybody that's comin' for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shit, you probably flinch if somebody sneeze <|LINE_BREAK|>
You see they got me back talkin' like it's just 40, Oli, and me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cuttin' all loose ends, I be the barber for free <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm almost at four minutes goin' off on the beat <|LINE_BREAK|>
Feel like I'm in the Malibu that had the cloth on the seats <|LINE_BREAK|>
Man, oh, you gotta love it, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
And on top of that it's getting harder to eat <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rappers downgrading houses, putting cars on the lease <|LINE_BREAK|>
To think labels said they'd have a problem marketing me <|LINE_BREAK|>
And now it's everybody else that's getting hard to believe <|LINE_BREAK|>
But, man, oh, you gotta love it (Oh) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
And head to toe, I'm Prada covered (Whoop) <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know your girl well, just not in public <|LINE_BREAK|>
Blame the city, I'm a product of it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Young nigga from the city <|LINE_BREAK|>

Now they wanna act like I do no good <|LINE_BREAK|>
Funny 'cause I really did more than I should <|LINE_BREAK|>
I made a decision last night that I would die for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Can't get me on the line so they hang me out to dry for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
You know 40 wants peace but I'm down to cut ties for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I can't sleep these days unless I take one <|LINE_BREAK|>
If they don't have a story these days, they'll make one <|LINE_BREAK|>
Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Doesn't matter where I go, I can never get away from it <|LINE_BREAK|>
They give me loyalty and I don't gotta pay for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same way, breads gotta break for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Keeping people fed is my only peace of mind now <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I turn the six upside down, it's a nine now <|LINE_BREAK|>
I made a decision last night that I would die for it
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
All these hand outs, man it's getting outta hand <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'ma start telling niggas "Get it how you can" <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got it right now so I'm everybody's friend <|LINE_BREAK|>
If I ever lose I bet we never speak again <|LINE_BREAK|>
I made a decision last night, I'd die for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just to show the city what it takes to be alive for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
First place, first place, man we can't be tied for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I only drove it five times, paid 1.5  for it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Keychain go jang-a-lang, I wanna do major things <|LINE_BREAK|>
MJ in every way, I just don't fade away <|LINE_BREAK|>
Six upside down, it's a nine now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like Mannie, like Stunna, man, shit is big time now <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I made a decision last night that I would die for it
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Dying, yeah, yeah, gangstas, gangstas, gangstas...)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Make me feel the same way that I did to you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Trust me when I say I thought it all through <|LINE_BREAK|>
Trust me when I say that shit is old moves <|LINE_BREAK|>
God made himself a way from me to you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tried to kill me but they still want the Views <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tried to kill me but I am very much alive on the six side <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I said I am very much alive on the six side <|LINE_BREAK|>

These are my One St. Thomas flows <|LINE_BREAK|>
Me, my niggas and some Madonna hoes <|LINE_BREAK|>
That look just like virgins but trust they down to go <|LINE_BREAK|>
Discussing life and all our common goals <|LINE_BREAK|>
Smart kids that smoke weed, honor roll <|LINE_BREAK|>
Look how the champagne diamonds glow <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fine dining pour another glass when the wine is low <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm in the crib stacking money from here to the ceiling <|LINE_BREAK|>
Whatever it is I got, it's clearly appealing <|LINE_BREAK|>
These other rappers getting that inferior feeling <|LINE_BREAK|>
I hope you feel it in your soul, spiritual healing <|LINE_BREAK|>
Take a look at yourself, the mirror's revealing <|LINE_BREAK|>
If you ain't got it, you ain't got it the theory is brilliant <|LINE_BREAK|>
People ask how music is going, I heard it pays <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just came off making two million in 30 days <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, "I guess it does" is what the message was <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sometimes I feel I be spending my money just because <|LINE_BREAK|>
With Weezy I'm just out here repping us <|LINE_BREAK|>
'til I get to shake the hand of the man that's blessing us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I know these niggas miss the mean lyrics <|LINE_BREAK|>
Kush got the room smelling like teen spirit <|LINE_BREAK|>
I ask kindly if no one out here would bring defeat up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Until I lose, for now I'm the game's single leader <|LINE_BREAK|>
I fly private so no one tells me to bring my seat up <|LINE_BREAK|>
And book a suite where me and your favorite singer meet up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Who you like, tell me who it is <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'mma make sure that that woman is the next one on my list <|LINE_BREAK|>
I should call it a night, but fuck it I can't resist <|LINE_BREAK|>
This one is for all the niggas from my city trying to diss <|LINE_BREAK|>
Without a response from me you really fail to exist <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I love to see you fail, that feeling there is the shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
I swear, pussy nigga get your bread up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Enjoy the seat that the stewardess just forced your ass to let up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Why your scary ass looking down, pick ya head up <|LINE_BREAK|>
No one told you your disguise was the most ridiculous get-up? <|LINE_BREAK|>
With nose-plugs in now, I can smell the set-up <|LINE_BREAK|>
So you just wasting your time, you only making me better, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
I try to tell them don't judge me because you heard stuff <|LINE_BREAK|>
Chase N. Cash that's my brother from the Surf Club <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, that nigga always kept it so hood <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back when we would smoke good at the Oakwoods <|LINE_BREAK|>
And have girls fall through like coins in the couch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now we just fucking all the bitches they warned us about <|LINE_BREAK|>
Scared for the first time, everything just clicked <|LINE_BREAK|>
What if I don't really do the numbers they predict? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Considering the fact that I'm the one that they just picked <|LINE_BREAK|>
To write a chapter in history, this shit has got me sick <|LINE_BREAK|>
But if I really do it don't expect to get a split <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause this truly is some shit I don't expect for y'all to get <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm nervous but I'mma kill it cause they 'bout to let the realest team in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Throwing up in the huddle nigga, Willie Beamen <|LINE_BREAK|>
But still throwing touchdown passes <|LINE_BREAK|>
In tortoise frame glasses, hopin' that someone catch it <|LINE_BREAK|>
People say that old Drake, we startin' to miss it <|LINE_BREAK|>
But they need to be a little more specific <|LINE_BREAK|>
Is this what y'all want? In my best Chris Tucker impression <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ducking your questions, fuck your suggestions <|LINE_BREAK|>
Money gets all of my love and affection <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cars all black like the cover of Essence <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm allergic to coming in second but I never sneeze <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y.M.O.E. nigga, yeah
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Uh, yeah, this what yall want <|LINE_BREAK|>
Octobers Very Own <|LINE_BREAK|>

<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Chances are most of the days you was lying around <|LINE_BREAK|>
I made money thats why these girls eyeing me down <|LINE_BREAK|>
By nineteen I might seem destined for millions <|LINE_BREAK|>
Promoters on my ass so I'm guessing they filled in <|LINE_BREAK|>
I take cues from my big boy Popz <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm the only young dude that the big boys watch <|LINE_BREAK|>
They getting foul on the star <|LINE_BREAK|>
But it's all eyes on me like I'm copying some vows for the bar <|LINE_BREAK|>
Get it? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Guess not <|LINE_BREAK|>
Picture me not strive <|LINE_BREAK|>
To land in the top ten slip in the top five <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same thing in the top four trust I'm hot boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe even the top three Trey you got me? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nowadays I peak they interests <|LINE_BREAK|>
Especially when life's bringing them pain and lately they been stressed <|LINE_BREAK|>
Money making brothers should take notes <|LINE_BREAK|>
See broke niggas is the problem and us is the scape goat <|LINE_BREAK|>
Somebody get the waiter <|LINE_BREAK|>
They need a second plate a this knowledge <|LINE_BREAK|>
If you ain't got it you could catch it later <|LINE_BREAK|>
My money and love is separate before I commit to date her <|LINE_BREAK|>
I put a split in the middle and learn to separate her
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It ain't about the rims on my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the ice on my watch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the coupe or my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Baby it's about the game
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Ridin' low <|LINE_BREAK|>
Layed back in the seat when I creep <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's just how I roll <|LINE_BREAK|>
With some fresh nice ones on my feet <|LINE_BREAK|>
Girl that's how it goes <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'm tryin' to find a chick I can meet who ain't 'bout the dough <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause it ain't all about that no more
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It ain't about the rims on my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the ice on my watch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the coupe or my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>

It ain't about the rims on my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the ice on my watch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the coupe or my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Baby it's about the game
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
When you ask why I hustle in the streets that's just who I be <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yo I live for the dough, for the flow, for feelin' free <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't too many other dudes you can choose to get this luxury <|LINE_BREAK|>
But without it all I'm still about the game
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
The haters wanna hate, but it ain't no thing no <|LINE_BREAK|>
Because the ladies choose to love me (cause they love me for what I do)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It ain't about the rims on my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the ice on my watch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about the coupe or my truck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Baby it's about the game
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It ain't about the shoes that I've got <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't about my dough or my rocks <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't the life I live, it don't stop <|LINE_BREAK|>

We've hooked up a couple times, we ain't took it there yet <|LINE_BREAK|>
You broke up with your man and ain't been with nobody else <|LINE_BREAK|>
You like, "Fuck these niggas," rather keep it to yourself <|LINE_BREAK|>
He did you wrong, he left you down bad <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now you can't trust nobody <|LINE_BREAK|>
You said, "Do anything, but just don't lie to me" <|LINE_BREAK|>
I said I ride for you, girl, you said you ride for me <|LINE_BREAK|>

Couple things I do damn well <|LINE_BREAK|>
And the way that I Jack son, you figure Drake knew Sam. L <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm for real though <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm from Memphis, I'm often labeled as Trill so <|LINE_BREAK|>
They stay kicking it with me like a field goal <|LINE_BREAK|>

I can't explain myself, All this Love (loving me)!!

Even when the sun don't shine, I know you're my sunshine <|LINE_BREAK|>
And even if the sun outside, we can anything baby <|LINE_BREAK|>

I am grateful to be able to call America my second home. Last night when I saw the video of Alton Sterling being killed it left me feeling disheartened, emotional and truly scared. I woke up this morning with a strong need to say something. <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's impossible to ignore that the relationship between the black and brown communities and law enforcement remains as strained as it did decades ago. No one begins their life as a hashtag. Yet the trend of being reduced to one continues. <|LINE_BREAK|>
This is real and I'm concerned. Concerned for the safety of my family, my friends, and any human being that could fall victim to this pattern. I do not know the answer. But I believe things can change for the better. Open and honest dialogue is the first step. <|LINE_BREAK|>
My thoughts and prayers are with the Sterling family and any family that has lost someone to this cycle of violence. <|LINE_BREAK|>
Be safe out there. More life.

Yo I wake up every morning, shower, gather my belongings <|LINE_BREAK|>
Head to works, I get some breakfast cause, still a nigga yawning <|LINE_BREAK|>
From the night before, at the club, I was up I'm tryna live <|LINE_BREAK|>
Only twenty two, my nig, 'bout to be twenty three, ya dig? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Time don't wait for none of us that's why I gotta chase my dreams <|LINE_BREAK|>
Make my momma proud so she can show off all her pearly teeth <|LINE_BREAK|>
And be half the man my dad was, I thank God he was in my life <|LINE_BREAK|>
I realize how many leave they wives so deep inside <|LINE_BREAK|>
Either I, need to make this music work or move from the Earth <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm preachin' fire, need a choir, 'bout to take you all to church <|LINE_BREAK|>
My congregation bombed the nation with this hip hop <|LINE_BREAK|>
We in the race to fame, blowin' pass the pit stops <|LINE_BREAK|>
I heard the prize was some chicks and a wrist watch <|LINE_BREAK|>
And all you gotta do is go to jail or get shot <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah Nick cop but he ain't never get popped <|LINE_BREAK|>
How we gonna get pop fans? Give 'em a quick shot <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now I get ya chick hot with my wrist watch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah shorty drip drop when it tick tock <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's kinda sick huh? Ay Jay, put an end to all the bickerin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
And tell them niggas this is Nick's spot <|LINE_BREAK|>
They don't keep it fresh enough I got it zip locked <|LINE_BREAK|>
Saran wrap, anthrax, it make ya sick huh? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm hot as fire wanna put me out with piss huh? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Reached to do it and realized his dick stuck
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits <|LINE_BREAK|>
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit <|LINE_BREAK|>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows <|LINE_BREAK|>
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's <|LINE_BREAK|>
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old <|LINE_BREAK|>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Ayo I stay up every evening, write that shit that they believe in <|LINE_BREAK|>
DJs run it, they approach me, and it's praise I be receiving <|LINE_BREAK|>
From the night befo', at the club, fake I.D. my record spins <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got me dancin' right outside since these niggas won't let me in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Well guess again, slip around the back and get it crackin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
And all the bottles wrapped in cellophane and party where the best have been <|LINE_BREAK|>
Hundred grand, Nickle F, that nigga's the next to win <|LINE_BREAK|>
Virgina gon' rep for him, and Memphis represent for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
To the tenth degree, Tennekey, T-Dot to the country y'all <|LINE_BREAK|>
Orange Mound and Whitehaven, and back up north to Montreal <|LINE_BREAK|>
I ain't ashamed, my city ain't on the map <|LINE_BREAK|>
People get to thinking they really light that fire, realize they ain't born to rap <|LINE_BREAK|>
So they give it pass the torch and sell they soul for enough to throw cash in storage <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe they can bring they career back <|LINE_BREAK|>
But these niggas right here ain't trynna hear that <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause I'm on set, make it work, break even on 9 to 5's <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cigarettes and lotto tickets, tryna keep that grind alive <|LINE_BREAK|>
All my uncles, they hit the casino when they get they check <|LINE_BREAK|>
My cousins, they paint they slabs and pop pistols to get respect <|LINE_BREAK|>
This can't be life, dominoes and chief and dro and twenty stacks <|LINE_BREAK|>
Single mothers phonin' cheaters just to get they honeys back <|LINE_BREAK|>
Purple drink and trips to Kroger's just to get they money stacked <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rest In Peace to SKUMMY this reality not funny rap! <|LINE_BREAK|>
You think it's funny till these youngings suck a bunny <|LINE_BREAK|>
Pull the jackrabbit out and get to screamin' where the money at?!
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It ain't as easy as it looks, we go through some shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
You cut us a check, then we go through some hits <|LINE_BREAK|>
Then you show us respect, then we'll say you legit <|LINE_BREAK|>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm trynna get that cash, then watch how tall it grows <|LINE_BREAK|>
Soon as we get the ass, we start callin' 'em ho's <|LINE_BREAK|>
The concept you don't grasp, I'm guessin' you too old <|LINE_BREAK|>
And this is the life that I lead from AM to PM

J.Cole wrote a beautiful and moving apology to individuals and families affected by autism who were understandably hurt by a verse in "Jodeci Freestyle". I share responsibility and offer my sincerest apologies for the pain this has caused. Individuals with autism have brilliant and creative minds, and their gifts should not be disparaged or discounted. This was a learning lesson for both of us, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to try to right this wrong. J. Cole and I believe that it is the right, responsible, and respectful decision to remove the lyric from the song.

I know who you are cause he wanted me to eat ya <|LINE_BREAK|>
I said nah lets keep it peaceful <|LINE_BREAK|>
My nigga was a true weed source <|LINE_BREAK|>
He gave it to us for a cheap cost, at prices we all could eat off <|LINE_BREAK|>
A real street dog <|LINE_BREAK|>
The type of nigga that y'all niggas be studying learning how to get street off <|LINE_BREAK|>
We have an impostor, alert the doctor <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bout to hit him up with the chopper like Blaka <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shock em like Blanka from Street Fighter, heat got a <|LINE_BREAK|>
Hurricane kick, murder everything quick <|LINE_BREAK|>
Look, my new Ryu nine is stupendous <|LINE_BREAK|>
Why do guys choose my crew to pick wit <|LINE_BREAK|>

The Scorpio's Mind is not a game to play wit all day

I've been hated by many, wanted by plenty <|LINE_BREAK|>
Disliked by some, but confronted by none <|LINE_BREAK|>
Since they don't show me sincerity, I load up, lock up <|LINE_BREAK|>

And compared to D <|LINE_BREAK|>
They one-fourth from watermelon to a quarter felon, dude you a pear to me <|LINE_BREAK|>
If that's not how it is it's how it appear to be <|LINE_BREAK|>
You got blind heaters, in my sweats is a mind reader <|LINE_BREAK|>
And when the psychic get to touching my palm <|LINE_BREAK|>
Seein' your physical, the things that you never say to me visible <|LINE_BREAK|>
Especially when one of your artists feeling threatened <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause I'm harnessing a weapon, won't you pardon my reflection <|LINE_BREAK|>
Mirror, mirror tell me why they wanna get and scrimmage <|LINE_BREAK|>
And play around, to perfection I'm the spitting image <|LINE_BREAK|>
My verbal camp is vivid, I told you I'm spitting image <|LINE_BREAK|>
It seems we often want to start but never get to finish <|LINE_BREAK|>
My verbal campus is Villanova, and those of you feelin Hova <|LINE_BREAK|>
And writing college rhymes, look the thrill is over <|LINE_BREAK|>
Let me assist you like a specialist <|LINE_BREAK|>
So you can pull it back and try catch the metaphors and the rest of this <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's not a problem wit X, I guess I'm a pessimist <|LINE_BREAK|>
Which means if shit goes bad I say, "I expected this" <|LINE_BREAK|>
And me and Julien we never got the chance to communicate <|LINE_BREAK|>
Instead of understanding its a tune of hate <|LINE_BREAK|>
The city's mine like Oklahoma's a Sooner state <|LINE_BREAK|>
And we're gonna have to cross paths whether soon or late <|LINE_BREAK|>
So, why don't you walk up in the spot using less strut <|LINE_BREAK|>
You ain't Morris Chestnut, you lighter and less cut <|LINE_BREAK|>
And lets be honest, by now you should be your own scholar <|LINE_BREAK|>
You still a protegé, that's the reason I don't holler <|LINE_BREAK|>

You stay ahead of the game, I'm ahead of the practice boy

Family, money, and music is all I ever knew <|LINE_BREAK|>
My necklace suffer from depression it's forever blue <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cheer up baby you don't see all this revenue? <|LINE_BREAK|>

Please, who's a real nigga and who ain't one? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Please, somebody stop me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm talkin' boasy and gwanin wassy <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got the fest in five days and it's my shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
Soon as a nigga hit the stage, they gon'
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, they want it back to back <|LINE_BREAK|>
They gon' ask if I can play this shit back to back <|LINE_BREAK|>
I took a break from Views, now it's back to that, nigga (Six)

It's what you all been waiting for, ain't it? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Your weekly entertainment <|LINE_BREAK|>
For me to get a hold of this beat and go 'head, claim it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm about to paint a picture, you niggas go 'head, frame it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Since we getting Seinfeld on some Jerry and Elaine shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
I flow far from mediocre <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if we talking cards, I will fold him with the poker <|LINE_BREAK|>
You and your whole crew are like a deck of 54 <|LINE_BREAK|>
So it's obvious y'all gon' steady be rolling with some jokers <|LINE_BREAK|>
And me, I'm rolling with some brokers <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like, damn, could you niggas get any broker? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got my new girl so content <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just save yourself the embarrassment, don't even approach her <|LINE_BREAK|>
Disguise yourself, go buy a costume <|LINE_BREAK|>
I am making stocks work while you working stock rooms <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ugh, and I was praying I would drop June <|LINE_BREAK|>
But label reps applying pressure to make them pop tunes <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I keep it rocking for Pete's sakes <|LINE_BREAK|>
You fake gangsta rappers are cliché <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if you ain't talking dough when you meet Drake <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be all in your face, like, "No speak-a la ingles" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Soon as you hear it, you quote it <|LINE_BREAK|>
They try to be the one that I done left out the show with <|LINE_BREAK|>
But trust me, I'm aware, and my car's right there <|LINE_BREAK|>
Is this interior enough for y'all ulterior motives? <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause if you like it, y'all should stick with me <|LINE_BREAK|>
My money good, I ain't never had to flip a ki <|LINE_BREAK|>
A lot of ice, a lot of cream like Dickie Dee <|LINE_BREAK|>
Might cut the phone and disapear like Michie Mee <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I'ma try and have you on the trip with me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sliding through Henri Bendel like it's slippery <|LINE_BREAK|>
And your ex-man is a hater, officially <|LINE_BREAK|>
Probably 'cause he know I'm exactly what you wish he be <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, that's the reason why he looking hard <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause I done snatched the Chips Ahoy out the cookie jar <|LINE_BREAK|>
He just mad 'cause his girl's at the house <|LINE_BREAK|>
With her tongue sticking out like a Michael Jordan rookie card <|LINE_BREAK|>
Let me address this, pardon me while I fix <|LINE_BREAK|>
A couple subliminal lines caught me in the mix <|LINE_BREAK|>
I guess he thought he could've been Gotti in the flicks <|LINE_BREAK|>
But at this point, I'm just poking a body with a stick <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nowadays, rapping is a children's hobby <|LINE_BREAK|>
And girls keep telling me I'm still this snobby <|LINE_BREAK|>
I tell them myself is who I am feeling, probably <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just because I got a buzz like a building lobby <|LINE_BREAK|>
It ain't a song that your ass finna skip <|LINE_BREAK|>
I tried to sell weed, give me cash for the zip <|LINE_BREAK|>
The way your girlfriend pumped me up in the car <|LINE_BREAK|>
Seem like she don't really need no gas for the trip <|LINE_BREAK|>
Millionaire shades, fade with the waves <|LINE_BREAK|>
I smirk at a nigga if he still rocking braids <|LINE_BREAK|>
That just lets me know that we ain't on the same page <|LINE_BREAK|>
And that goes out to every nigga except Trey <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm outta here, baby <|LINE_BREAK|>
They asked me about the past years and how does it phase me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I wouldn't take it back, nah, not if they paid me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Mr. Bet You That's Expensive 'cause it's not a fugazi <|LINE_BREAK|>
Spitting a Crock Pot of bottomless gravy <|LINE_BREAK|>
The shit is so nasty, how is it tasting? <|LINE_BREAK|>
And you can probably find him walking out of a Macy's <|LINE_BREAK|>
Forget it, girl, they just thinking how to replace me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Exit with a joke, leave these niggas some hope <|LINE_BREAK|>
You took that 'Ye beat and put that shit in a choke <|LINE_BREAK|>
Well, I'm thinking I should leave out on this note <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nigga, keep your two cents, I ain't tryna leave you broke
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Life of a don, lights keep glowing <|LINE_BREAK|>
Come up in the club with that fresh shit on <|LINE_BREAK|>
And something crazy on my arm, uh-ahem <|LINE_BREAK|>
And here's another hit, Barry Bonds

<|endoftext|>



<|startoftext|>

You can't love, but I bet ya <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yo can't hine yeah
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Here we Gooo <|LINE_BREAK|>
The 1st time around <|LINE_BREAK|>
I left the cars at the house <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I put the diamonds down <|LINE_BREAK|>
Them things come and they go it's bout the rhyme-in Now <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm seeing it clearer, the season is nearer <|LINE_BREAK|>
And still I must change, I'm like a broken bill <|LINE_BREAK|>
Conservative for the most but I'm out spoken still <|LINE_BREAK|>
They not sure it'll work but their all hoping <|LINE_BREAK|>
He'll emerge the victim, my words are pictures <|LINE_BREAK|>
And yes the colors so loud that you heard my scripture <|LINE_BREAK|>
With four walls <|LINE_BREAK|>
Give me the right brush and I draw all <|LINE_BREAK|>
I promise I been thinkin' before ya'll <|LINE_BREAK|>
I barely get tired, I'm rarely inspired <|LINE_BREAK|>
And you accomplish in a week is What I'm daily required <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm meetin' quotas while you rappers having sleep overs <|LINE_BREAK|>
Spending nights in studio try to be Hova <|LINE_BREAK|>
Be in the throne instead of being ya own <|LINE_BREAK|>
But look
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Young Check your freestyle <|LINE_BREAK|>
I am fast approachin' on the weekend <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's me, Niko, Bryans here, D10 <|LINE_BREAK|>
Freestyle shit bout to segway to the verse here we go
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It's like I'm makin' moves in my city though <|LINE_BREAK|>
My ex girls wanna be up in the video <|LINE_BREAK|>
They ex girls are steady tryin' to get with me though <|LINE_BREAK|>
Important and vital <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm caught in a cycle <|LINE_BREAK|>
And this is all I know <|LINE_BREAK|>
And yes I know it well <|LINE_BREAK|>
I try to explain <|LINE_BREAK|>
And my effort comes to no avail <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm from the place where they release records and no one sells <|LINE_BREAK|>
And still they claim king <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nigga it's the same thing <|LINE_BREAK|>
All day long <|LINE_BREAK|>
But that's the screw face <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rappers will friend you at first but really they two faced <|LINE_BREAK|>
Hoping you trip and slip over your own shoe lace <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I tuck em in not givin' a fuck again <|LINE_BREAK|>
D.R.A you add the K.E a hundred grand and you labels can not <|LINE_BREAK|>
Play me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll never go broke <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fuck em I'm flashin' the pan <|LINE_BREAK|>
I am a passionate man <|LINE_BREAK|>
Planted with cash in my hand uhh
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Look... I got few days left <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'm a make use of every single one <|LINE_BREAK|>
Untill every singles done and till every record is sold <|LINE_BREAK|>
And till every string is strung <|LINE_BREAK|>
They tell me to take a breather and Drake everything will come <|LINE_BREAK|>
Dog... it's always been the same <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's all love <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like no score in a tennis game <|LINE_BREAK|>
For the son of Dennis James <|LINE_BREAK|>
Owner of the city downtown on a Friday <|LINE_BREAK|>
Streets behind me like I took a picture in a driveway <|LINE_BREAK|>
I roll down strips and hosed down whips that when turtles wax up <|LINE_BREAK|>
They will close down richmond <|LINE_BREAK|>
With no down shiftin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Haters will say I'm adequate <|LINE_BREAK|>
I think I got the type of flow to make a addict quit <|LINE_BREAK|>
19 years I been pimpin' since then repurchased Trap Muzik 4 time since then <|LINE_BREAK|>
Seamless transition I'm the new fresh prince gettin' pennies for my thoughts <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I put my 2 cents in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Top of the mornin' I am dropin' a coin in plus <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm changin' the game you see me swapin' a joint in <|LINE_BREAK|>
They put fire out bring the buyers out and try to box us all together <|LINE_BREAK|>
For they buy us out <|LINE_BREAK|>
They profit from the event <|LINE_BREAK|>
We handin' fliers out <|LINE_BREAK|>
We profit from the attempt to hand desires out <|LINE_BREAK|>
But rich is how we're all endin' up <|LINE_BREAK|>
So if you selling charter Jetts call Brenden up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Holla!

<|startoftext|>

Yeah, look
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
You know how the paigon chit-chat goes <|LINE_BREAK|>
I like R's and V's and O's <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't really play no tic-tac-toe <|LINE_BREAK|>
Been with Chubbs through highs and lows <|LINE_BREAK|>
We seen man last night, they froze <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just like that one time at 'Chella <|LINE_BREAK|>
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Stay in big six-six with woes <|LINE_BREAK|>
Man start dissin' and doin' reposts <|LINE_BREAK|>
They do anything except road <|LINE_BREAK|>
Still can't see them after it snows <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't have time for the wasteman jokes <|LINE_BREAK|>
Personal ting if I'm gettin' up close <|LINE_BREAK|>
Loyal to O 'cause I've taken a oath <|LINE_BREAK|>
Versace hotel and I'm takin' the robes <|LINE_BREAK|>
Seen 'em in person, I'm seein' a ghost <|LINE_BREAK|>
They told me relax 'cause they're takin' control <|LINE_BREAK|>
Take all that shit up with P and his bro <|LINE_BREAK|>
I wish you the best, let me know how it goes <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wanna be free and I wanna let go <|LINE_BREAK|>
We came around and you showed us the most <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know so much shit that I cannot expose <|LINE_BREAK|>
I keep it inside and I laugh on my own <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got all the tea and I'm hottin' it up <|LINE_BREAK|>
I need a shade mansion, a room's not enough <|LINE_BREAK|>
You're droppin' some shit but that shit was a bust <|LINE_BREAK|>
They got no direction, they're followin' us <|LINE_BREAK|>
I come from a city that they never touch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Your man is a goofy and he could get brushed <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't name a rapper or girl that I trust <|LINE_BREAK|>
I dream about turnin' these yutes into dust
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Ayy, ayy, ayy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah

You know how the paigon chit-chat goes <|LINE_BREAK|>

Wasn't no cameras, wasn't no pose <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just like that one time at Nobu <|LINE_BREAK|>
Good thing man weren't pullin' out phones
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Think you know me? That's not true <|LINE_BREAK|>
We got ties in West End too <|LINE_BREAK|>
She came over and she got slewed <|LINE_BREAK|>
Throwin' up six like man had flu <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got way too big off Views <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back to the basics, I won't lose <|LINE_BREAK|>
They wanna link when they got no chunes <|LINE_BREAK|>
They too worried 'bout sellin' out shoes <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't give a fuck 'bout jeans and crep <|LINE_BREAK|>
Or goin' to Milan or goin' to the Met <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just wanna make these songs for the set <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just wanna load that and let that wet <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got so much tings in the stash <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fold up anyone, dun that clash <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got no sense like Jizzle and shh <|LINE_BREAK|>
Big and bad like leader and shh <|LINE_BREAK|>
Can't do love 'cause they get too attached <|LINE_BREAK|>
Phone get broke and whip get scratched <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'ma just take my knots in cash <|LINE_BREAK|>
They can never tie me down, that's facts <|LINE_BREAK|>
All that bark but we know he's a cat <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't really like goin' tit for tat <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'ma just come like tat-tat-tat <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'ma just end that there, that's that

And these rappers in a panic <|LINE_BREAK|>
But Belly told me to do me <|LINE_BREAK|>
And don't listen to anybody that knew me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause to have known me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Would mean that there's a new me <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if you think I changed in the slightest could of fooled me <|LINE_BREAK|>
And tell my city I'm the two-three <|LINE_BREAK|>
Drug dealers live vicariously through me <|LINE_BREAK|>
No bench time, nickname started Drake <|LINE_BREAK|>
Franchise player, I don't even get a water break <|LINE_BREAK|>

I hope that you don't take it wrong <|LINE_BREAK|>
You don't even trip when friends say <|LINE_BREAK|>
"You ain't bringin' Drake along?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
You know that I'm workin', I'll be there soon as I make it home <|LINE_BREAK|>

Magazine paper, girl, the money ain't the issue <|LINE_BREAK|>

I know everyone is enjoying the circus but I want to clarify this image in question. This was not from a clothing brand shoot for my music career. This picture is from 2007, a time in my life where I was an actor and I was working on a project that was about young black actors struggling to get roles, being stereotyped and type cast. The photos represented how African Americans were once wrongfully portrayed in entertainment. Me and my best Friend at the time Mazin Elsadig who is also an Actor from Sudan were attempting to use our voice to bring awareness to the issues we dealt with all the time as black actors at auditions. This was to highlight and raise our frustrations with not always getting a fair chance in the industry, and to make a point that the struggle for black actors had not changed much

I'm tryin' to tell you something that you prolly should know <|LINE_BREAK|>
This that slumdog millionaire Bollywood flow <|LINE_BREAK|>
And ahh, my real friends never hearing from me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I pick and choose <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't get shit confused <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm not with different crews <|LINE_BREAK|>
We walk the same paths, but got on different shoes <|LINE_BREAK|>
We live in the same building, but we got different views <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a couple cars, I never get to lose <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't like my women single, I like my chicks in twos <|LINE_BREAK|>
And these days all the girls is down to roll <|LINE_BREAK|>
We hit the strip club, and all them girls find a pole <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell your girl to tell her friend that it's time to go <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell me today's weather <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know they say they good but trust me I'm better <|LINE_BREAK|>
I sound like the coldest Miami night ever <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm cold but still hot you can't decide on a sweater <|LINE_BREAK|>
Really this whatever and I am murdering and this is so amusing <|LINE_BREAK|>
If there's a sight to see I am an illusion <|LINE_BREAK|>
I tell you I'm the man baby, what is the confusion <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if they still sleeping on me someone hit the snooze then <|LINE_BREAK|>
Keep sleeping while I sell a couple million <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm headed for the moon, I ain't bout to hit the ceiling <|LINE_BREAK|>

But fuck what they say, let me tell you how I'm feeling <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm drinking, these London street lamps got a real glow <|LINE_BREAK|>
Drizzy playin' driving fast but it feels slow <|LINE_BREAK|>
And ask your man, he's a hater baby he don't know <|LINE_BREAK|>
I could kick a punt and turn that shit into a field goal <|LINE_BREAK|>
This here was meant to get buried <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a lot of things, I mention those barely <|LINE_BREAK|>
I ain't lyin' to the kids, like the dentist ain't scary <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm what Lebron was to St. Vincent-St. Mary's <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I ain't playin' high school games <|LINE_BREAK|>
Pulling McClarens through a McDonald's drive through lane <|LINE_BREAK|>

This here is on some truthful shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
It seems like everything I do, you're used to it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I hate hearing stories 'bout who you've been with <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's when I gotta hide what I'm feeling inside <|LINE_BREAK|>
So you still think I'm confident, and damn <|LINE_BREAK|>
Is this gonna last? <|LINE_BREAK|>
You're up on a pedestal, are we moving too fast? <|LINE_BREAK|>

Oh, girl (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
This here is something personal <|LINE_BREAK|>
I highly doubt this feeling is reversible <|LINE_BREAK|>
Knowledge is pain and that is why it hurts to know <|LINE_BREAK|>
That you attempt to hide and put mistakes aside <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I don't ever question you, and damn <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't even find the perfect brush <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I can paint what's going through my mind <|LINE_BREAK|>
Racing against myself, but I'm a couple steps behind <|LINE_BREAK|>

Tell me who the fuck you want to be <|LINE_BREAK|>

Can I call instead of text you on the hotline? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sometimes a nigga wanna hear your voice <|LINE_BREAK|>
Can I see you right now, I know the sun is up, baby? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sorry, I don't really have a choice <|LINE_BREAK|>
Can I ever make you feel like I'm down for you, baby? <|LINE_BREAK|>

And these haters like, damb m <|LINE_BREAK|>
Gave a lot of women they first ride in the phantom <|LINE_BREAK|>
And yeah, I got a deal now, and I'm secure with it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And yet my life is so exciting, I get bored with it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm the best one out of my peers, and everybody pray I'm running out of ideas <|LINE_BREAK|>
Past my MOs, cause I shine so bright <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'm the result of when it all goes right <|LINE_BREAK|>
So many pictures, man, the floor is a collage <|LINE_BREAK|>
Critics have hard time pointing out the flaws <|LINE_BREAK|>
All this slick talk, I just hope I don't fall <|LINE_BREAK|>
Right out of the sky, through the roof of your garage
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
How could I fly, but lose it all <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm a cannonball <|LINE_BREAK|>

It's a joke, but you say you real—I don't understand <|LINE_BREAK|>

Can't have everything, can't have everything <|LINE_BREAK|>

Finally got my mind in a free state <|LINE_BREAK|>
Niggas tried to serve me up a cheesesteak <|LINE_BREAK|>
I gave them back a clean plate <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same niggas preein' cause they hate to see the team straight <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same niggas beakin', always duckin' my release dates <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's when the phone starts ringin' like, "Are we straight?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Two-faced niggas back around with the three face <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, ol' triple double, Russ face, watch with the bust face <|LINE_BREAK|>
Never-met-the-plug-but-I-rap-about-the-plug face <|LINE_BREAK|>
Never-met-myself, I-don't-remember-who-I-was face <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all fuckin' hilarious <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all really think y'all niggas teamin' up is scarin' us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all niggas is arrogant, y'all sleep at the Sheraton <|LINE_BREAK|>
All that shit embarrassin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell your big homie I'm all for goin' there again <|LINE_BREAK|>
He ain't even die and I ball with his inheritance <|LINE_BREAK|>
All that's in my account at the Bank of America <|LINE_BREAK|>
All that Drake hysteria <|LINE_BREAK|>
6 side, East side, all that for my area
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
You know, hun, I'm a bit concerned about this negative tone that I'm hearing in your voice these days. I can appreciate where your uncertainty stems from and you have reason to question your anxieties and how disillusioned you feel, as well as feeling skeptical about who you believe you can trust. But that attitude will just hold you back in this life, and you're going to continue to feel alienated. Give some thought to this, because I’m confident in you, and I know you can reach your desired destination and accomplish your goals much more quickly without this confrontation I'm hearing in your tone these days. When others go low, we go high.

None of that shit matter now <|LINE_BREAK|>

Stop, stop, stop… <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas <|LINE_BREAK|>
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up <|LINE_BREAK|>
I’m so sorry <|LINE_BREAK|>
Did you hope I was crying? <|LINE_BREAK|>
It was rough without you <|LINE_BREAK|>
It was rough without you
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I did some charity today for the kids <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I'm used to it 'cause all y'all charity cases <|LINE_BREAK|>
All y’all stare in my face in hopes you could be the replacement <|LINE_BREAK|>
Niggas is snitchin' on us without no interrogation <|LINE_BREAK|>
I stay silent 'cause we at war and I’m very patient <|LINE_BREAK|>
Six God is watchin', I just hope you’re prepared to face him <|LINE_BREAK|>
I’m charged up, I’m charged up
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Wow, I’m honored that you think this is staged <|LINE_BREAK|>
I’m flattered, man, in fact I’m amazed <|LINE_BREAK|>
The perfect start to the summer, man, this shit is a doozy <|LINE_BREAK|>
This shit a twist in the movie, but don't jump to conclusions <|LINE_BREAK|>
You boys are gettin' into your feelings on me <|LINE_BREAK|>
You should embrace it, this could be one of our realest moments <|LINE_BREAK|>
Okay, the flow start to feel familiar, don’t it? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Must I remind you that Jimmy got 20 million on it? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Need DJ Clue to drop a bomb on it <|LINE_BREAK|>
None of them want this shit more than I want it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I seen it all comin', knew they would push a button <|LINE_BREAK|>
East egg huntin', they gotta look for somethin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Done doin' favors for people <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause it ain’t like I need the money I make off a feature <|LINE_BREAK|>
I see you niggas havin' trouble goin' gold <|LINE_BREAK|>
Turnin' into some so and so’s that no one knows <|LINE_BREAK|>
But so it go <|LINE_BREAK|>
Come live all your dreams out at OVO <|LINE_BREAK|>
We gon' make sure you get your bread and you know the ropes <|LINE_BREAK|>
I get a ring and I bring it home like I’m Cory Joe <|LINE_BREAK|>
No woman ever had me star struck <|LINE_BREAK|>
Or was able to tell me to get my bars up <|LINE_BREAK|>
I’m charged up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh no we eatin', niggas ain’t about to starve us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nah, niggas ain't about to starve us <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm charged up
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I bought my niggas rollies off of Thank Me Later <|LINE_BREAK|>
While these boys was stanky leggin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Trust me this information is vital <|LINE_BREAK|>
I’m tryin' to take the high road <|LINE_BREAK|>
I still got love for my idols <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got me a deal with Apple and I still feel entitled <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rumor has it, there’s somethin' that only I know <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rumor has it, I steer the ship with my eyes closed <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rumor has it, I either fucked her or never could <|LINE_BREAK|>
But rumor has it, hasn’t done you niggas any good <|LINE_BREAK|>
It’s sound, sound, sound ‘til the day I die <|LINE_BREAK|>
We goin' live to keep this shit alive <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cops are killin' people with they arms up <|LINE_BREAK|>
And your main focus is tryna harm us? <|LINE_BREAK|>
And you think you ‘bout to starve us? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Niggas ain’t about to starve us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nah, I’m charged up!
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
(Stop, stop, stop, stop…) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Have you seen me? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I’m doing so good <|LINE_BREAK|>
Every time we meet: <|LINE_BREAK|>
"Oh, I’m so sorry." <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Fuck niggas gon' be fuck niggas <|LINE_BREAK|>
That’s why we never give a fuck when a fuck nigga switched up)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
"You know, I kept it real <|LINE_BREAK|>
It ain’t too many real people out here <|LINE_BREAK|>
And people be on some weak bitch-ass shit all day long <|LINE_BREAK|>
Industry people… regular people… <|LINE_BREAK|>
And then when you keep it real with people, they cross the line, take your kindness for weakness and that’s weak."

Which made everything right with X (Songz) <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got too many records and not enough shows <|LINE_BREAK|>
Far too many rappers and not enough ___ <|LINE_BREAK|>

Times've changed now I'm older mama <|LINE_BREAK|>
And these niggas ain't solid they fold in drama <|LINE_BREAK|>

A compilation of mental thoughts that I never note <|LINE_BREAK|>
And "Hi, haters <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm back off of hiatus <|LINE_BREAK|>
How ya album doin'? <|LINE_BREAK|>

I said, "Damn, really? Even Rosemary? Even Leann Sealy?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
They said, "Fucking right, they were the first to go" <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's nothing personal <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's just that all them women that you slept on been working though <|LINE_BREAK|>
They've been saving up, new niggas came around, they been waking up <|LINE_BREAK|>
With "I swear, you don't know this city anymore <|LINE_BREAK|>
They might have loved you before <|LINE_BREAK|>
But you're out here doing your thing, they don't know you" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ah, sure they do, they just not as sincere <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's crazy all the emotions forgot in a year <|LINE_BREAK|>
She like, "Why you even give a fuck, you not even here?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Well, out there there ain't nothing for me and I think I need to come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind? <|LINE_BREAK|>
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind <|LINE_BREAK|>
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Uh, but believe I remember it all
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I be with my nigga Chubbs, he in love with street shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
No wonder why I feel awkward at this Fashion Week shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
No wonder why I keep fucking up the double-cheek kiss <|LINE_BREAK|>
And long for that ignorant Young Money Miami Beach shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
Couple artists got words for me, that's never fun <|LINE_BREAK|>
They say it's on when they see me, that day don't ever come <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm never scared, they never real, I never run <|LINE_BREAK|>
When all is said and done, more is always said than done <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I was told once, things will change <|LINE_BREAK|>
By a nigga named Tip when my deal came <|LINE_BREAK|>
Told me it's all good, even when it feel strange <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now I'm that guy that know them strippers by their real names <|LINE_BREAK|>
Rochelle, Jordan <|LINE_BREAK|>
Thick bitches, they just talked me out of four grand <|LINE_BREAK|>
How'd a pile of kush become a mountain of truth? <|LINE_BREAK|>
How'd a bottle of wine become the fountain of youth? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, my biggest fear is losing it all <|LINE_BREAK|>
Remember how I used to feel at the start of it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And now I'm living a muhfucking fairy tale <|LINE_BREAK|>
And still trying to keep you feeling a part of it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, just lie to my ears <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell me it feel the same, that's all I've been dying to hear <|LINE_BREAK|>
Lights get low and that's when I have my brightest ideas <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I heard my city feel better than ever, that's why I gotta come home

Tell me, who did I leave behind? <|LINE_BREAK|>
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind <|LINE_BREAK|>
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Uh, but believe I remember it all
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
My mother is back to who she was years ago <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's like a new page me and her are beginning on <|LINE_BREAK|>
I wish she'd stop checking up on women I can't stand <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause I got new girls I could use her opinion on <|LINE_BREAK|>
She thinks I've become a slave to the wealth <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I'd never break the promises I made to myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I would never make up names for myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
Then change the names that I just gave to myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
Certain rappers would call me to say "What up, though?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
I used to brag about it to my friends <|LINE_BREAK|>
And now I'm feeling like all of these niggas cutthroat <|LINE_BREAK|>
And maybe that's all they do is just pretend <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, but I bought it though, I believed it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I thought it and I achieved it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, so show me love, show me fuckin' love <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause I thought it was all I needed <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, clearly I was wrong about it all along <|LINE_BREAK|>
And this'll be the year that I won't even feel shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
They trip off the amount of people that I brought along <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I'm just trying to be surrounded by some real shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
Need credentials for every one of these Toronto kids <|LINE_BREAK|>
I promised they'd see it with me, we just trying to live <|LINE_BREAK|>
I told 'em we about to get it and we finally did <|LINE_BREAK|>
Listen closely to my shit, I swear it's sounding like home
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Tell me, who did I leave behind? <|LINE_BREAK|>
You think it got to me, I can just read your mind <|LINE_BREAK|>
You think I'm so caught up in where I am right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Uh, but believe I remember it all
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Well, you see, the way I feel about the music, it can be copied, you know? <|LINE_BREAK|>
But, it’s not copy do it, it’s the feel, you know? It carry a feel <|LINE_BREAK|>

The startin's hot but pay attention to my latter flows <|LINE_BREAK|>
Givin' brain ain't bad girl, don't be that opposed <|LINE_BREAK|>
I flatter hoes <|LINE_BREAK|>
And drink Dom, they always ask me, "Is that a rose?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
"You mean Rosé? Why yes it is" <|LINE_BREAK|>
I stopped trying years ago, this is effortless <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm in your house got the key to your home <|LINE_BREAK|>

Verse 1: Drake <|LINE_BREAK|>
I always wonder why you bother putting makeup on <|LINE_BREAK|>
You don't need it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And even though I always tell you that you're beautiful <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll repeat it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause I don't want no singer, I don't want no model <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I don't want no fashion designer or nothing <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just want your love <|LINE_BREAK|>
I promise you that's more than enough for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Chorus: <|LINE_BREAK|>
All you gotta do is come real <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shawty what the deal? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Dont think just cause you simple that you lose your appeal <|LINE_BREAK|>
I wouldn't have it any other way (2x) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Verse 2: Kyoko <|LINE_BREAK|>
Baby just because I wanna look good <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't mean that I ain't real <|LINE_BREAK|>
Not in the least bit <|LINE_BREAK|>
All the clothes and doing of my hair, face, nails <|LINE_BREAK|>
Make me feel good <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'll keep it up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Im not sayin what you been stayin to me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't exactly <|LINE_BREAK|>
What I need to feel and know <|LINE_BREAK|>
You're the one I'm wearing for <|LINE_BREAK|>
And where I'll always go when I need a real love <|LINE_BREAK|>
Kyoko Chorus: <|LINE_BREAK|>
So stay real <|LINE_BREAK|>
What you make me feel <|LINE_BREAK|>
Is true beauty of the ultimate appeal <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I don't want it any other way (2x)

Yeah, this dedicated to Canada man <|LINE_BREAK|>
The whole up North <|LINE_BREAK|>
A lot of people don't realize how cold it gets during the Winter <|LINE_BREAK|>
But listen
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I met this new girl late June or early July <|LINE_BREAK|>
I called her a bunch of times but she barely replied <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now it's December, I'm driving, and she's like "Where's my hi?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's weird that I never called you cause I rarely get shy <|LINE_BREAK|>
See that was a segue, I believe the matter <|LINE_BREAK|>
Is what happens after the season where the leaves just scatter <|LINE_BREAK|>
Where the Timb' laces get tighter and parka hoods flip up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Drug dealers standing in their park or hood slip up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Where girls become exes from Summer's caught ho'in <|LINE_BREAK|>
The winter cars come out, the summer cars go in <|LINE_BREAK|>
And some places is breezy, and some it start snowin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if you planning family vacations you better know when <|LINE_BREAK|>
But some mothers scared to send they daughters out the city <|LINE_BREAK|>
Instead she get a sweater that she bought her out of pity <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause mom stays up late, she seen them videos <|LINE_BREAK|>
Where Cancun college students pouring water on their titties!
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Yeah man, it's a funny thing going through the winter up here man <|LINE_BREAK|>
A lot of girls y'know, wanna get close. you might think they the one <|LINE_BREAK|>
But just wait, nah mean, take it slow
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Forget to mention, this girl that never gets to the beach <|LINE_BREAK|>
She lives just West of my street, and so we destined to meet <|LINE_BREAK|>
Since I'm driving, I ask her how to get to the suite <|LINE_BREAK|>
She doesn't answer, opens the door and just gets in the seat <|LINE_BREAK|>
She throws her bag in the back, and starts adjusting the heat <|LINE_BREAK|>
She's bold but I roll with it, I'm impressed cause she's sweet <|LINE_BREAK|>
Then she says "I heard your song and I'm obsessed with the beat <|LINE_BREAK|>
I mean, the lyrics are good, but I'm obsessed with the beat <|LINE_BREAK|>
I love it when Voyce sings and the chorus is good <|LINE_BREAK|>
There's a couple things in the song that I suggest you repeat" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Off this I'm kinda taken back for a second <|LINE_BREAK|>
I get her number she tells me to call her after this session <|LINE_BREAK|>
And so I do, and it's kind of awkward, the surface hard to scratch <|LINE_BREAK|>
Until we end up sexin' and now my heart attached <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm thinkin off I should've been more Southern <|LINE_BREAK|>
And realizing all that she wanted was that indoor lovin' and ho!
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Yeah, uh, I told ya'll I had a story for you right <|LINE_BREAK|>
Uh, ya man, it's what it is
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
And now, I'm proud to have her like Montreal to the frizzench <|LINE_BREAK|>
She love to play hurt like Carter did on the bizzench <|LINE_BREAK|>
But, my boy say I'm actin different, because I lay downtown <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I still I rush to pick her up from work and fizzench <|LINE_BREAK|>
She tellin everyone I'mma hold here down <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell everyone I'm the prince up in this cold clear town <|LINE_BREAK|>
And stupid me I just listen to her <|LINE_BREAK|>
Instead of wondering if this is really gon' last me the whole year round <|LINE_BREAK|>
But then Spring shows up, and it's Dallas in this bitch <|LINE_BREAK|>
The weather starts to resemble the holidays she missed <|LINE_BREAK|>
When we were together it seeming like way back when <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ball players hop on the plane and make it way back in <|LINE_BREAK|>
See she used to play piana, and now she never wait for santa <|LINE_BREAK|>
Instead of saving for marriage, she saving for caribana <|LINE_BREAK|>
And it's a shame, she had me convinced that she could've been a dime <|LINE_BREAK|>
I guess, I lost another one to the wintertime
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I miss you, most of all, my darling  <|LINE_BREAK|>
(give me a second to gather my thoughts) <|LINE_BREAK|>
 Strolling in the park (Ho!) <|LINE_BREAK|>
And watching winter turn to spring (Such a beautiful day man) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Yeah man, you know we had to switch it on 'em right?) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Strolling in the park and watching winter turn to spriing <|LINE_BREAK|>
(I'm still standing on two feet, even after this tragic loss) <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Man, but I got something to else to tell ya baby)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I remember them encore PMs, breakfast and the wake up <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now Drake's committed we waiting on the breakup <|LINE_BREAK|>
So we can get back to them cognac nights <|LINE_BREAK|>
With dress codes and light skinned girls that won't act right <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I laugh cause my previous lifestyle was quite wild <|LINE_BREAK|>
The winter came and blew his cold air through <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back then light sweaters and a couple drinks might get her <|LINE_BREAK|>
By the end of the week I would know that crew <|LINE_BREAK|>
And we'd assembled a trio, a whole new scene <|LINE_BREAK|>
With three ladies in the shot we never broke routine <|LINE_BREAK|>
At the end of every cut when the cameras are rollin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
We had ladies hearts always gettin damaged and stolen <|LINE_BREAK|>
But this Summer is different it's a two man operation <|LINE_BREAK|>
Granted the fact that we one man short <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got love for him he can watch this new man stop a nation <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause handlin' crack is a one man sport <|LINE_BREAK|>
Instead of dress-up, I walk in sweat pants and charms clinkin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I find a girl we step dance and calm drinkin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
The face, the breast, the bras, the toes <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm still solo and a long night draws to a close <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause it's a fact, if she come to the crib and I get some ass inside <|LINE_BREAK|>
We'll never talk again, scary and true <|LINE_BREAK|>
That song Special I recorded with Voyce well it's like a classified <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's what I'm lookin for to carry me through <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yet I can't seem to find it, every girl that possesses it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Only wants a friendship causing me to forget the shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
And when they talk about they past and lovers <|LINE_BREAK|>
And you get mad at the thought of it giving ass to others <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yet you find peace with yourself, now least there's some room to ride <|LINE_BREAK|>
There's also Room For Improvement as soon as June arrive
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring <|LINE_BREAK|>
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring <|LINE_BREAK|>
Strolling in the park, and watching winter turn to spring

That shit was wack as fuck <|LINE_BREAK|>
I was like, 'You won. Why are you posting your text message? Just chill. Take your W, and if you feel you didn't deserve it, go get better — make better music. It felt cheap. It didn't feel genuine. Why do that? Why feel guilt? You think those guys would pay homage to you if they won? <|LINE_BREAK|>
This is how the world works: He made a brand of music that appealed to more people than me, Hov, Kanye and Kendrick. Whether people wanna say it's racial, or whether it's just the fact that he tapped into something we can't tap into. That's just how the cards fall. Own your shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
To name just Kendrick? That shit made me feel funny. No, in that case, you robbed everybody. We all need text messages!

<|endoftext|>

And say, "You ain't got the juice like that <|LINE_BREAK|>
You ain't got the juice like that" <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's cold, ice cold, girl you ain't have to do him like that <|LINE_BREAK|>

Yeah, she workin' with the spatula, I know she love flippin' shit, oh! <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, me, I don't deserve it (at least you fuckin' know it) <|LINE_BREAK|>
She's just a little too perfect, she's just a little too worth it <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't deserve her at all, no not at all <|LINE_BREAK|>
I only text her, man, I never call <|LINE_BREAK|>

All I gotta do is put my mind to this shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
I like all my exes ...

<|startoftext|>

Uh, black hearts on my cardigan <|LINE_BREAK|>
At the crib tellin ya girl that we should order-in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell G to put his feet up on the ottoman <|LINE_BREAK|>
We just up against a bunch of rappers I go harder than <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn! I'm so Catriona smarter than <|LINE_BREAK|>
A lot of these niggas swear the coach just brought the starter in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, and I'm the type to tell ya daughter things <|LINE_BREAK|>
I float high, don't try and cut my water wings <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm still myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
Suicide bars, I kill myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
Charge it to the game, I bill myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I don't feel y'all, but I feel myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
Aunty Doe, tell 'em I deserve a mazel tov <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm rappin' like a Shepherd with the muzzle off <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm next to blow, pause <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I can't hear the critics talkin' over the applause {crowd cheers} <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I tried to tell 'em, Future let 'em know <|LINE_BREAK|>
Send the haters all my love, X and O <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a black box where suggestions go <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I don't really give a fuck, it's prolly best you know <|LINE_BREAK|>
My reality is brighter than your dreams are <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got your dream girl ridin' in your dream car <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, and the visual is stunnin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I hope they document what I'm becomin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Congratulations
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
So what you want an award or somethin'? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm at the private airport boardin' somethin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I see nothing from afar but I'm far from nothing <|LINE_BREAK|>
Put on your poker face, I'll pull ya card if you're bluffin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I ain't with the hard talk <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a monopoly, catch me on my boardwalk <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like I said we pull your card and find out you're a Hallmark <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just know I'm breakin' world records, no false start <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't see your point unless it's gunpoint or somethin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
My deal like Weezy first week, one point somethin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
And my verses gettin' stupider <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wayne if you're on Mars, can you pick me up from Jupiter? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Phone blowin' up, so I'm cuttin' off my cellular <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm a superstar, noted on to my nebula <|LINE_BREAK|>
I will break a leg, break an arm and a fibula <|LINE_BREAK|>
When I break it down, when I, when I break it down <|LINE_BREAK|>
I hug and kiss the drum kick <|LINE_BREAK|>
I put the beat in my back pocket and just sit <|LINE_BREAK|>
But, you could never beat my ass, pause <|LINE_BREAK|>
Again, dammit y'all, again <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all, pretend that we are, some men that get it on, and in <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll die before I lose, 'cause I was born, to win <|LINE_BREAK|>
If he don't fuck with y'all, then don't bother him <|LINE_BREAK|>
And yes, I fuck this game but I won't father them <|LINE_BREAK|>
Right, uh
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
It's like, these days man, I'm booked and I'm busy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Dad named me Drake, Footz named me Drizzy <|LINE_BREAK|>
They tried to tell me I'd never be nothin' but a protege <|LINE_BREAK|>
But if you watched the VMAs, there's nothing more to say <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got the key to happiness and all the copies <|LINE_BREAK|>
Remember this day like you bought a poppy <|LINE_BREAK|>
And damn, how I get so nice? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just spent it all once, 'bout to get rich twice <|LINE_BREAK|>
Surprise party bitch, now it's on and poppin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I always choose dough like it's my only option <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause money always knows best <|LINE_BREAK|>
Chain snatch flow, they say "Get it off your chest" <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'm what all the fuss about <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if they talkin', I bet I'm what they discussion 'bout <|LINE_BREAK|>
Hit me at the office, same extension <|LINE_BREAK|>
Consider me the reason y'all should pay attention

"There’s 3 balls and a strike. Here's the pitch. It's belted deep to center, Revere goes back, jumps at the wall, and it's gone!"
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Isn't it amazing? <|LINE_BREAK|>
How you talk all this shit and we still lack communication <|LINE_BREAK|>
How beautiful our kids would be, girl, I don't need convincing <|LINE_BREAK|>
How every conversation starts with "this time will be different" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, the idea is fun, oh, the idea is fun <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, the idea is so fun every time <|LINE_BREAK|>
At least we try for home run every time
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Swanging, eyes closed, just swanging <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same city, same friends, if you're looking for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same city, same friends, if you're looking <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be here just swanging <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't talk to me like I'm famous <|LINE_BREAK|>
And don't assume, 'cause I don't respect assumptions, babe <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm just tryna connect with somethin', baby <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, swanging
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
She just wanna run around the city and make memories <|LINE_BREAK|>
That she can barely remember <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'd allow her <|LINE_BREAK|>
Talk about pussy power <|LINE_BREAK|>
She just wanna run over my feelings <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like she drinking and driving in an 18 wheeler <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'd allow her, talk about pussy power <|LINE_BREAK|>
She used to say: "You can be whoever you want, even yourself" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I show up knowin' exactly who I was <|LINE_BREAK|>
And never leave as myself <|LINE_BREAK|>
But when it falls apart, I'm always still down <|LINE_BREAK|>
To pick a million tiny little pieces off the ground <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wish you would learn to love people and use things <|LINE_BREAK|>
And not the other way around
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Swanging, eyes closed just swanging <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same city, same friends if you're looking for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Same city, same friends if you're looking <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be here just swanging <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't talk to me like I'm famous <|LINE_BREAK|>
And don't assume cause I don't respect assumptions bae <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm just tryna connect with somethin' baby <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be here, just swanging
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I remember when my schedule was as flexible as she is <|LINE_BREAK|>
She call and tell me be here before the sun up <|LINE_BREAK|>
I be dressed before we hung up <|LINE_BREAK|>
I take Eglinton to 401 east <|LINE_BREAK|>
And exit at Markham road in the east end <|LINE_BREAK|>
Where all the pretty girls are sleeping <|LINE_BREAK|>
My license been expired I renew it after the weekend <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fuck I know I said that shit the last 7 weekends <|LINE_BREAK|>
Girl I guess procrastination is my weakness <|LINE_BREAK|>
I hate stoppin' for gas this late <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause there's niggas creepin and not like how we're creepin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Summer is comin' know you could feel it <|LINE_BREAK|>
20 on pump whatever I ain't got enough to fill it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Won't knock on your door <|LINE_BREAK|>
My uncle say, "You drive my whip like it's yours" <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got the pedal to the floor <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm on my motherfuckin' way, swangin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't fall asleep on me, hang in there <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be there just swangin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be there just swangin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I treat you good, girl, like you're famous <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know I'm late, it's always the same shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
But don't fall asleep on me, hang in there <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm on the road right now swangin, girl

Whoa, yeah (There's a) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ooh (Yeah)

Take your nose off my keyboard <|LINE_BREAK|>
What you bothering me for? <|LINE_BREAK|>
There's a room full of niggas <|LINE_BREAK|>
What you following me for? <|LINE_BREAK|>
This ain't no fucking sing-along <|LINE_BREAK|>
So, girl, what you singing for? <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4 <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4 <|LINE_BREAK|>
20, keep the bar rolling <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fake ID's in the trash, we going <|LINE_BREAK|>
Straight to the top, rooftop glows <|LINE_BREAK|>
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign <|LINE_BREAK|>
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland <|LINE_BREAK|>
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland <|LINE_BREAK|>
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland <|LINE_BREAK|>
Why? 'Cause
<|VERSE_BREAK|>

<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Smoking weed under star projectors <|LINE_BREAK|>
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us <|LINE_BREAK|>
But seeing my family have it all <|LINE_BREAK|>
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall <|LINE_BREAK|>
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming <|LINE_BREAK|>
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing <|LINE_BREAK|>
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation <|LINE_BREAK|>
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces <|LINE_BREAK|>
All it took was patience <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I told my story, and made history <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20 <|LINE_BREAK|>
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing <|LINE_BREAK|>
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
They loving the crew <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh, they loving the crew <|LINE_BREAK|>

I've got a lot to say, and that's the last thing a nigga wanna hear right now
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh <|LINE_BREAK|>
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh <|LINE_BREAK|>
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm about to ride through the old hood right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got too much pride for my own good right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
I'm terrible at invitin' myself, call me over <|LINE_BREAK|>
Those nights when you need someone else, call me over <|LINE_BREAK|>
You can be the one to take control, call me over <|LINE_BREAK|>
When I get there, you already know, call me
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Why you keep askin' me about... (Why?) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Couple other things I'd rather do than talk about that right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Told you 'bout givin' him chances on chances on chances <|LINE_BREAK|>
He's not holdin' you down, he's holdin' you back right now
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Spendin' all my days on the east side, oh (Oh, oh-oh-oh) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Forgettin' who I was on the other side, oh <|LINE_BREAK|>
Young nigga switchin' up the program right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tryna put the power in my own hands right now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Love it when your ass speak the truth to me, oh <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tryna wake up and have you with me, oh <|LINE_BREAK|>
Waitin' on you to give in and hit me up <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I could fall through like old times and hit it up

<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Yeah, ayy <|LINE_BREAK|>

I I threw my hands in the air and said show me somethin', yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ayy
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Remember one night I went to Erykah Badu house <|LINE_BREAK|>
She made tea for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
We talked about love and what life could really be for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
She said, "When that shit is real, you just know" <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I was thinkin' 'bout you, you already know <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, the other night Chubbs showed up at my house <|LINE_BREAK|>
He had weed for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
That my nigga 'til we gone, keep his ear to the streets for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Said the city stress him out on the low <|LINE_BREAK|>
I said, "I feel you, nigga, I already know" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, already... <|LINE_BREAK|>
Girls talkin' 'bout, "You gotta leave already?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, my lil' nephew turned four already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Gave you little help, you need more already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, you need more already? <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Fore you said "You're mine" I was yours already <|LINE_BREAK|>
22, had the Bentley four-door already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Even as a boy, I was the boy already <|LINE_BREAK|>
So you know that that mean pussy galore already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Mention other girls, you get insecure already <|LINE_BREAK|>
That was in the past, I matured already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Fuck them hoes, you got the award already <|LINE_BREAK|>
You go to Chanel and get rewards already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Know I do this shit for Third Ward already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Know I do this shit for H-Town already <|LINE_BREAK|>
Already, already, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back up in this thing, it's a go <|LINE_BREAK|>
Had a couple niggas out of pocket, now they know <|LINE_BREAK|>
Ain't the first time 'cause I lost you before <|LINE_BREAK|>
Had to get it back, had to get it back <|LINE_BREAK|>
Had to pull it back because I know I'm on the road <|LINE_BREAK|>
Had to take you back because I know you're down to roll <|LINE_BREAK|>
If you can get it from me, you can have it, now you know <|LINE_BREAK|>
All your friends askin' where you stand with the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
FaceTime say you got plans for the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Studyin' your body, that's exams for the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Take a flight here, pop a Xan for your boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Waking up in Amsterdam with the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Long flight home, 'nother Xan for your boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
You would prolly fly out to Japan for the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
You would prolly kill another man for the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
You would prolly... <|LINE_BREAK|>
You would prolly lie 'bout it on the stand for your boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Put the Bible to your right hand for the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why you ain't never gotta worry 'bout the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
You know you got... <|LINE_BREAK|>
You know you got that really good insurance on the boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
You just gotta pack a bag and hurry to the boy, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>

Ayye Yo DJ Wristpect let's get em' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Veterans like "How dare all of this arrogance" <|LINE_BREAK|>
What you expect when all they do is draw comparisons between us and Americans <|LINE_BREAK|>
And tell me go hard well I'm going harder now <|LINE_BREAK|>
Bumpin Shawn Carter cause there ain't a Shawn Carter now, feel me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Get with it, I'm trying to overthrow a nation using fade to black as a nigga's only motivation <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm picking and choosing an army and thinking of moving my talent is proven <|LINE_BREAK|>
A show of hands who's in? <|LINE_BREAK|>
And if you must know, this year I'm going for the gusto plus though seat feeling like a bus load <|LINE_BREAK|>
So take me as I am  have nada of me the red stripe on my jacket show you that Prada love me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm a threat in a city of no legends imagine that a whole Sistine with no brethrens <|LINE_BREAK|>
No blood glide gunshots identity this you a rapper homie leave that for Trinity Chris word <|LINE_BREAK|>
See my role models roll with models and switch gold bottles holding more dough than the whole lotto <|LINE_BREAK|>
So while you clowns making toasts in a cheap bar the whole ATF make mimosas with the clicquot <|LINE_BREAK|>
What up Nikko, Jordan, Lucky and TJ nicknamed the Night Fox clique we take it easy <|LINE_BREAK|>
You Prime Ministers claim you repping the T, I need a Motherfucking president to represent me nigga

<|startoftext|>

I don't even need a note pad for this one right here man <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shut the lights off <|LINE_BREAK|>
Let the mind work ya know <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'd like to ummm <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'd like to take the time to dedicate this to a special somebody <|LINE_BREAK|>
Guess I'll call her my most recent addition to my collection to female disappointments
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Deceiving you are the reason that <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't believe in finding the love that I need and <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm Uncle Phil I switch wifey like every season <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I guess that makes you Aunt Viv <|LINE_BREAK|>
Until you take from me till the point that you can't give <|LINE_BREAK|>
And when I see you out I pass by it's offensive <|LINE_BREAK|>
But what you expect though <|LINE_BREAK|>
Kinda direct yo <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause all that Dolce and Gabana shit was expensive <|LINE_BREAK|>
I told ya <|LINE_BREAK|>
Mr. Edwards I tried to save your daughter <|LINE_BREAK|>
But she wasn't satisfied with none of the things that I bought her <|LINE_BREAK|>
And wasn't tryna show up none of the places that I brought her <|LINE_BREAK|>
And couldn't utilize none of the things that I taught her <|LINE_BREAK|>
So I was just tryna upgrade you <|LINE_BREAK|>
I ain't ya understudy thats tryna upstage you <|LINE_BREAK|>
I was ya other buddy that tried to front page you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Crown you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Get to know the people that surround you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Funny to think that I woulda white gowned you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause now we sit around the studio and clown you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oops did I let that slip <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh my bad did I let that slip <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't forget that quick
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Deceiving you are the reason that <|LINE_BREAK|>
When it gets cold in November seems like it's freezing <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I fit every stereotype that y'all believe in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause when I say I'm serious you claim you're only teasin <|LINE_BREAK|>
I planned a trip to the tropics that you missed <|LINE_BREAK|>
So when I'm speakin you only in topic when I'm pissed <|LINE_BREAK|>
And in a couple years I guarantee you'll be thirsty <|LINE_BREAK|>
And by then I'll be lookin like Tropicana twist <|LINE_BREAK|>
What up Tessa I love you like my own mama <|LINE_BREAK|>
And ya daughters getting grown mama <|LINE_BREAK|>
And me I'm just here workin' waitin' patient <|LINE_BREAK|>
For her to be ready for to love and leave her drama <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cause I don't really wanna fight no more <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I don't wanna diss niggas when I write no more <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I don't wanna bring chicks to the crib <|LINE_BREAK|>
To watch a flick in the basement on the bed with dim lights no more <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now I'm losing a feeling <|LINE_BREAK|>
You losing appealing <|LINE_BREAK|>
You need to step it up like prints from shoes on the ceiling <|LINE_BREAK|>
Oh damn did I let that slip oh my fault did I let that slip <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't forget that quick
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
My first reaction was damn girl <|LINE_BREAK|>
How did I swing you? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I wanted you forever now I'm something you cling to <|LINE_BREAK|>
But you was my angel, Seems like ya wings grew <|LINE_BREAK|>
Unaware you was outta state doin' ya thing too <|LINE_BREAK|>
Sayin' to my self you deceiving <|LINE_BREAK|>
You are the reason that I don't believe in finding the love that I need <|LINE_BREAK|>
In fact I know you always be lyin' when u be leavin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Goin' to visit family promise me you ain't cheatin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
A sure thing just might fail you <|LINE_BREAK|>
Women often conduct themselves just like males do <|LINE_BREAK|>
They huddle in a group and joke about the fact that you a soft nigga <|LINE_BREAK|>
How you think cuddling with is cute <|LINE_BREAK|>
They laugh at how you think you last when you really don't <|LINE_BREAK|>
And make u think u get the ass when you really won't <|LINE_BREAK|>
And dudes do that and why these hoes stealin' it <|LINE_BREAK|>
They doin the same shit with a better job at concealin' it <|LINE_BREAK|>
So sign your name on a prenupt and then initial <|LINE_BREAK|>
She only messin with a rapper if it's beneficial <|LINE_BREAK|>
Opps did I let that slip oh my bad did I let that slip <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't forget that quick
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Deceiving (you you you you deceiving) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Deceiving (you you you you are so deceiving)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Feel like uh <|LINE_BREAK|>
I feel like we back man (yeah) <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's like See, see the problem with these other brothers is that they makin love songs <|LINE_BREAK|>
We makin beyond and above songs you know what I'm sayin <|LINE_BREAK|>
We sayin real stuff we not bitter it's life you know <|LINE_BREAK|>
If ya'll females would pull it together <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe we would have something better to talk about

For my nigga Hush <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, look
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Dressed in fatigues, I rep the East with my trustees <|LINE_BREAK|>
Smokin' on crushed leaves <|LINE_BREAK|>
They turn they back on everything we built, then they must bleed <|LINE_BREAK|>
I've seen splatter hit the snow when the blood freeze <|LINE_BREAK|>
Straps over territory they know we must keep <|LINE_BREAK|>
Get home and white Air Forces get brushed clean <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back when my mama would interrupt sleep <|LINE_BREAK|>
To tell me hurry up 'cause the bus leaves <|LINE_BREAK|>
Summertime heatwaves, I used to just cut sleeves <|LINE_BREAK|>
My shorty really love me, man, she want me to cut keys <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't do that normal type of life, is it just me? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Niggas steady try to ride the wave, but it's rough seas <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm losin' enough sleep dealin' with envy <|LINE_BREAK|>
And the news that they sent for me got the block in a frenzy <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's on Meech like it's trendy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Runnin' round from Laurier to MacKenzie when the city's empty, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
Early twenties, but I want fifties, hundreds, not pennies <|LINE_BREAK|>
I need plenty <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got me ready to flip the F out like Fendi <|LINE_BREAK|>
Whatever's in me, it's takin' over <|LINE_BREAK|>
I gotta bust it down, break it open <|LINE_BREAK|>
Until somebody starts takin' notice, then we rollin'
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now we rollin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now we rollin'
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Look <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back when Big Apple sold dreams, I stuck to my own thing <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back when the house that I own now was my home screen <|LINE_BREAK|>
Before I'd ever hit the road and feel like the home team <|LINE_BREAK|>
Runnin' missions <|LINE_BREAK|>
Pyramid schemes just like the Egyptians <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back when hotlines were still flippin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now I'm seein' money off of hotlines blingin' but it feels different <|LINE_BREAK|>
Transitions, plans switchin', ambition <|LINE_BREAK|>
Mindin' my business, buildin' a business, et cetera <|LINE_BREAK|>
Inspired by a few, but my mind really drives itself like Tesla <|LINE_BREAK|>
I always had a little somethin' extra <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back when Corey was our sole investor <|LINE_BREAK|>
And the car could get from A to B, but won't impress ya <|LINE_BREAK|>
Look, I ain't no baller <|LINE_BREAK|>
Still need my accounts longer like the way my nephew's gettin' taller <|LINE_BREAK|>
My soundtrack is the second Carter, dreamin' of acceptin' offers <|LINE_BREAK|>
And easin' tensions <|LINE_BREAK|>
Keepin' family out of East Detention <|LINE_BREAK|>
And out of Pine Hill Funeral Center <|LINE_BREAK|>
Spots we got no business enterin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Back when Jill Scott was the apple of my afrocentric eye <|LINE_BREAK|>
I had to find a way to get someone's attention
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Then we rollin', then we rollin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now we rollin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, then we rollin', then we rollin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Deep pockets on a nigga, I can't find my phone in <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now we rollin'

All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down <|LINE_BREAK|>
Opinions over statistics, of course <|LINE_BREAK|>
Gassed off journalistic <|LINE_BREAK|>
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report <|LINE_BREAK|>
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course <|LINE_BREAK|>
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course <|LINE_BREAK|>
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, "What scent that is, boy?" <|LINE_BREAK|>
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, who am I? The do or die <|LINE_BREAK|>

They try to compare us, but <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I <|LINE_BREAK|>
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride <|LINE_BREAK|>
All factual, I call the house "the embassy" <|LINE_BREAK|>
The studio "the chapel", I hate to travel <|LINE_BREAK|>
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural <|LINE_BREAK|>
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends <|LINE_BREAK|>
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz <|LINE_BREAK|>
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential <|LINE_BREAK|>
I broke spirits that I never meant to <|LINE_BREAK|>
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine <|LINE_BREAK|>

2010 was when I lost my halo <|LINE_BREAK|>
2017 I lost a J. Lo <|LINE_BREAK|>
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though <|LINE_BREAK|>
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes <|LINE_BREAK|>
Closed off but I could never stay closed <|LINE_BREAK|>
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños <|LINE_BREAK|>
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie <|LINE_BREAK|>
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't <|LINE_BREAK|>
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy <|LINE_BREAK|>
Protection that God gave me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies <|LINE_BREAK|>
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages <|LINE_BREAK|>
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers <|LINE_BREAK|>
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here <|LINE_BREAK|>
Cover my ears, my security government tier <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, advance the venue so we know the exits <|LINE_BREAK|>
Check the guest list <|LINE_BREAK|>
If opps make an appearance at least it's expected <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be in better company with my own reflection <|LINE_BREAK|>
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace <|LINE_BREAK|>
The TV playin' Al Jazeera <|LINE_BREAK|>

Repercussions of a cheap lash <|LINE_BREAK|>

This lifestyle is foul this shit'll damage ya <|LINE_BREAK|>
Especially when you think noone is understanding ya <|LINE_BREAK|>
These girl groups with they overprotective managers <|LINE_BREAK|>
Got paparazzi over my shoulders clickin they cam-er-a <|LINE_BREAK|>
Snap snap snap until they runnin outta card space <|LINE_BREAK|>
You remind me of Tony's sister in scarface <|LINE_BREAK|>
Just take it easy on love and slow ya heart rate <|LINE_BREAK|>
Goodness gracious on top is such a hard place <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yea... but if you never even been there <|LINE_BREAK|>
You kinda make sense why you dying of pretendin <|LINE_BREAK|>
Spillin all ya drinks takin pictures in ya swimwear <|LINE_BREAK|>
Head up in the clouds you survivin on the thin air <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know that shit is exhausting girl <|LINE_BREAK|>
And your mistakes are costing girl <|LINE_BREAK|>
And maybe you don't need the help but I just wanna see for myself

<|startoftext|>

Silence keeps cloudin' me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Hand on my heart <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I, I wish time never mattered
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Yeah, stylin’ though <|LINE_BREAK|>
Dissin' but got pictures with me smilin' though <|LINE_BREAK|>
All the things you need, you still want problems though <|LINE_BREAK|>
All the things I know, I still been silent though <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, used to be at SilverCity, Indigo <|LINE_BREAK|>
Used to be in lunchroom, playin’ dominoes <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't want to have to go to funerals <|LINE_BREAK|>
I gotta start sleepin' at the studio <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't have no time to be no Romeo <|LINE_BREAK|>
All the love I need is at the rodeo <|LINE_BREAK|>
All the love I need is here at OVO, yeah <|LINE_BREAK|>
All the girls I know are there with E and Tho <|LINE_BREAK|>
Who knows where I end up when that shit gets old? <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe it never gets old and that's just how it goes <|LINE_BREAK|>
Last table left in Carbone, callin' plays on the rotary phone <|LINE_BREAK|>
I take a glass of Domina to go with me home <|LINE_BREAK|>
Might move our annual shit to the 'Dome <|LINE_BREAK|>
I need 40,000 people to see what I'm on <|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, ducked a lot of spiteful moves <|LINE_BREAK|>
I was an angry yute when I was writin’ Views <|LINE_BREAK|>
Saw a side of myself that I just never knew <|LINE_BREAK|>
I’ll probably self-destruct if I ever lose, but I never do <|LINE_BREAK|>
Steady doin' double shifts <|LINE_BREAK|>
1da doin’ the beat and I open up like a double click <|LINE_BREAK|>
More blessings because I'm generous <|LINE_BREAK|>
Thirty-seater plane for like ten of us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Remember when I bought Sealey the fake Chanel wallet <|LINE_BREAK|>
She knew that shit was a fraud but never told me about it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Nowadays when we catchin' up we just laugh about it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Can't describe what my life is like when she asks about it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Scary whenever I close my eyes at night <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wakin’ up to public statements about my private life <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can never sleep 'til mornin' on all my quiet nights <|LINE_BREAK|>
But you can rest assured that my mind is right <|LINE_BREAK|>
Get no sick days, I leave for like three months in six days <|LINE_BREAK|>
Never stick around to see shit change <|LINE_BREAK|>
Get lil' updates, texts in my inboxes have been poppin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Seasons go by like I'm binge-watchin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
Went from Club Palazzo in the Bridge to Club LIV <|LINE_BREAK|>
To not even showin' up at a club 'less we doin' biz' <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't even party while a nigga pursuin' this <|LINE_BREAK|>
Distractions will do you in, in the truest sense <|LINE_BREAK|>
Especially people that want to lecture me <|LINE_BREAK|>
And frame it like they just want the best for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Or they check for me, whatever splits it up <|LINE_BREAK|>
So there's more for them and there's less for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
They don't know they got to be faster than me to get to me <|LINE_BREAK|>
No one's done it successfully <|LINE_BREAK|>
7AM in Germany, can't believe that they heard of me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Last verse that I gotta do is always like surgery <|LINE_BREAK|>
Always tryin' to let go of anything that'll burden me <|LINE_BREAK|>
That's the reason you can feel the tension and the urgency <|LINE_BREAK|>
Last chance I get to make sure that you take it personally <|LINE_BREAK|>
Take this shit to heart, it's always executed perfectly <|LINE_BREAK|>
If we do a song it's like takin' my kids to work with me <|LINE_BREAK|>
You overnight celebrity, you one day star <|LINE_BREAK|>
Swear I told you that I'm in this bitch for eternity <|LINE_BREAK|>
I am a reflection of all of your insecurities <|LINE_BREAK|>
Behind closed doors, a lot of 6 God worshipping <|LINE_BREAK|>
Done talk now, 'cause there's other shit that's concernin' me <|LINE_BREAK|>
There's real ones around me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I want to make sure they learn from me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I want to see my dog, but his grandmother's his surety <|LINE_BREAK|>
He can't even dip out to see me in an emergency <|LINE_BREAK|>
My life is centered 'round competition and currency <|LINE_BREAK|>
Takin' summer off, 'cause they tell me I need recovery <|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe gettin' back to my regular life will humble me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'll be back in 2018 to give you the summary <|LINE_BREAK|>
More Life

I can't believe it (I know you got a man) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?) <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's all right with me, my girl <|LINE_BREAK|>
We can do anything (Kick it to you like this)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Why you over there looking at me <|LINE_BREAK|>
While your man standing right beside you? <|LINE_BREAK|>
The temporary happiness he might provide you <|LINE_BREAK|>
But you know and I know that nobody gon' do you like me <|LINE_BREAK|>
Tryna save you like a goalie in line-of-sight <|LINE_BREAK|>
I know that I feel her, but slowly, I'm kinda like <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't really wanna hit this girl <|LINE_BREAK|>
And still, she want this chap's stick like Napoleon Dynamite <|LINE_BREAK|>
Well, I'ma give it to you, honeybunches <|LINE_BREAK|>
You feel it all under your ribs like some tummy crunches <|LINE_BREAK|>
All my other girls all up on that subtle shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
They don't wanna cut it, they want a rapper to cuddle with <|LINE_BREAK|>
Consequences keep weighin me down <|LINE_BREAK|>
So whenever she thinks I'm serious, I'm playing around <|LINE_BREAK|>
It gets deeper and colder, the funny thing is <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm writing this in my head as she asleep on my shoulder, like...
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Why are you trying to be my girl? <|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't believe it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?) <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's all right with me, my girl <|LINE_BREAK|>

Look, we had a lil' thing, a wintertime fling <|LINE_BREAK|>
You some getback for your man mistreating <|LINE_BREAK|>
But that was then, you know, some hush-hush <|LINE_BREAK|>
I ain't never really see a future in us <|LINE_BREAK|>
Plus, your man still there, let's be fair <|LINE_BREAK|>
You'd do the same things to me <|LINE_BREAK|>
My feelings never did go past some late-nigh- smash <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'on't wanna take the place of he <|LINE_BREAK|>
Late nights, 85 South on my way to the crib <|LINE_BREAK|>
And somebody got a song for me <|LINE_BREAK|>
I already know what you about, 'cause I been the other man <|LINE_BREAK|>
And you not gonna trap me with your silly lil' plan <|LINE_BREAK|>
It's my bad, should've chose a wo-man <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I'm in the mix with this lil' girl, playing <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm saying, you need to do what you do <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm not tryna take it any further with you, c'mon
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?) <|LINE_BREAK|>

Ugh, ugh, I met her at the bar, sipping on Patrón <|LINE_BREAK|>
And now, it's been three years off and on <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause the same page, we are rarely often on <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause when I'm in, she out, and when she in, I'm gone (C'mon) <|LINE_BREAK|>
We lost contact like Bausch & Lomb <|LINE_BREAK|>
But regained it while she was building a house and home <|LINE_BREAK|>
Wit this new cat, sayin that he doin her right <|LINE_BREAK|>
It just proves that she don't know what to do with her life <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause if so, she wouldn't have to change her strategy <|LINE_BREAK|>
And wouldn't need me to recharge her batteries <|LINE_BREAK|>
One minute, she mad at me; next minute, it's all good <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'm in her body like "Gray's Anatomy" <|LINE_BREAK|>
I don't understand why God sent me to you <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I cain't try to justify that foul shit we do (Ugh) <|LINE_BREAK|>
All I know is that each time I'm stickin you <|LINE_BREAK|>
I think to myself, "Damn, if only her nigga knew," but... <|LINE_BREAK|>
(Hahaha, yeah)
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Don't you have a man? (Don't you got a man?) <|LINE_BREAK|>
Why are you trying to be my girl? <|LINE_BREAK|>

Getting down tonight if they say you cuttin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
A lot of dudes in my city, they ain't saying nothin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
A lot of records from here, they get no play <|LINE_BREAK|>
And these labels don't give advances so you get no pay <|LINE_BREAK|>
Them little rims on the ride, Imma let those stay <|LINE_BREAK|>
So these nosy niggas don't know that I get checks all day <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Whats he worth?' Fans keep trying to guess it <|LINE_BREAK|>
My record ain't even finish, they keep trying to press it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Boi-1da and Drake if it's beef I address it <|LINE_BREAK|>
And the black Phantom is here soon as Visalia exit <|LINE_BREAK|>
Both of the deals, nothin' under a mill <|LINE_BREAK|>
We know you got it to give and we trying to collect it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Long as I got me some heat through the winter <|LINE_BREAK|>
Drake known as a pro, I'ma teach you beginners <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Bout to ink with a major like sheets through a printer <|LINE_BREAK|>
For features, y'all better get me while it's cheaper than dinner <|LINE_BREAK|>

You hatin' my song but your wife wanna burn it <|LINE_BREAK|>
So now you at the store for some blank CDs <|LINE_BREAK|>
You can't see me, for your sake, might wanna return it <|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause, if you bring them discs home to ya girl <|LINE_BREAK|>
She'll forget you and I'll be the only one she concerned with <|LINE_BREAK|>
To the people that ignored me before this <|LINE_BREAK|>
This one is for you as a song re-recorded <|LINE_BREAK|>
Funny thing is, you just notice me now <|LINE_BREAK|>
But I was here along, your vision's just been distorted <|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm so throwed, wilin' in this, you ask me what the business is <|LINE_BREAK|>
And I'll write a sixteen and record it <|LINE_BREAK|>
The waiting is over I think music needed <|LINE_BREAK|>
Drake cuttin' his records without gettin' weeded <|LINE_BREAK|>
People in the South want it chopped and screwed <|LINE_BREAK|>
I got this dude they expectations I'ma exceed it <|LINE_BREAK|>
Like a single with only backgrounds <|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all record and when it's done, ya lyrics tend to mislead shit <|LINE_BREAK|>
Finally here I'ma star with the timin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
My swagger is chill, and my flow is reclinin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
This for anybody that's searchin' for cash <|LINE_BREAK|>
And purchasin' fast, you only get the dough when you grindin' <|LINE_BREAK|>
And so I grind like I'm listening to I Wayne <|LINE_BREAK|>
My pain, you can experience through the rhymin', boy

<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Two years ago, a friend of mine <|LINE_BREAK|>
Asked me to kick some new school lines <|LINE_BREAK|>
And so I sent him a rhyme, it was fresh to death <|LINE_BREAK|>
Now not signing me is somethin' that the rest regret <|LINE_BREAK|>
Then I, hopped inside the Cadillac <|LINE_BREAK|>
The chauffeur drove off and we never came back
<|VERSE_BREAK|>
Stance on lean, leg up on the wall <|LINE_BREAK|>

It is, it is, but you know, the more and more, we were consistent, it proved, it turned from a flaw to an attribute. You know, it's like, it makes the story better, I think at this point
