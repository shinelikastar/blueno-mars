The other night<|LINE_BREAK|>
Lavish Lee told me that I'm all these people listen to<|LINE_BREAK|>
She said they love me unconditional<|LINE_BREAK|>
Imagine how it feel to watch another nigga at the top<|LINE_BREAK|>
You know that if you wasn't you, you would be dissin' you, dawg<|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, okay, from that perspective<|LINE_BREAK|>
I see what you're talkin' 'bout, no way to soften that<|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause me, I was tryna find out where I lost 'em at<|LINE_BREAK|>
But maybe I ain't lose 'em at all<|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe I keep movin' forward and they're just stagnant<|LINE_BREAK|>
They ain't movin' at all<|LINE_BREAK|>
But when they need a favor, who do they call?<|LINE_BREAK|>
Maybe I'm searchin' for the problems<|LINE_BREAK|>
Askin' what was said and who was involved<|LINE_BREAK|>
Too focused on people's feedback and provin' 'em wrong<|LINE_BREAK|>
They say the shoe can always fit, no matter whose foot it's on<|LINE_BREAK|>
These days feel like I'm squeezin' in 'em<|LINE_BREAK|>
Whoever wore 'em before just wasn't thinkin' big enough<|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm 'bout to leave 'em with 'em<|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause if I run in the game in these, man, the seams are splittin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
No pun intended but they're smellin' defeat in the air<|LINE_BREAK|>
Headed where nobody took it, who meetin' me there?<|LINE_BREAK|>
They tell him that he's talkin' crazy but he doesn't care<|LINE_BREAK|>
Bein' humble don't work as well as bein' aware<|LINE_BREAK|>
Listen up, boy, you're better off eavesdroppin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
We already got spring 2015 poppin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
PND droppin', Reps-up P droppin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
Majid Jordan droppin', OB droppin', not to mention me droppin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
Feel like we paid the refs off, man, we fixed the game<|LINE_BREAK|>
Me and Noel been at it before Twitter names<|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, been on the move like the lease is up<|LINE_BREAK|>
And I can't even name one person that's keepin' up<|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, fuck how it was in the past tense<|LINE_BREAK|>
Ask yourself, how do we match up now?<|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause I'm only 27 and I'm only gettin' better<|LINE_BREAK|>
If I haven't passed you yet, watch me catch up now, for real

<|VERSE_BREAK|>

Could it be the way that I'll catch up<|LINE_BREAK|>

Fake friends write the wrong answers on the mirror for me<|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I pick and choose, I don't get shit confused<|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a small circle, I'm not with different crews<|LINE_BREAK|>

The first time, the first time I met Robyn Fenty was 2005. She was shooting a music video at a restaurant called Avacado in Toronto, the song was "Pon de Replay," and the director... and the director of the video was Little X. I was introduced to her as the kid who played background music at the restaurant as people ate their dinner. It's hard to believe that eleven years later all three of us would come together the visual for her song called "Work."<|LINE_BREAK|>
Today the world knows Little X as Director X, they know me as Drake and not the kid singing while you order pasta. But eleven years later, they still know Rihanna as the one and only, Rihanna.<|LINE_BREAK|>
Captivating from day one, the iconic being that is Rihanna was already at a place where most artists only dream of going. For them, that's often the peak, but for her, that was a starting point, as she has kept ascending to an untouchable level ever since.<|LINE_BREAK|>
When it comes to music, she relentlessly takes over the charts with every release. When it comes to performances, they swarm in masses just to be in her presence... obviously... And when it comes to fashion and style, she makes it seem so effortless until you try to do it yourself, which is when it gets a little awkward.<|LINE_BREAK|>
What's most impressive isn't the endless list of stats, awards and accomplishments. What's most impressive is the person. Some artists need to play a character to achieve success, some need to downplay their own natural instincts to blend in. She succeeds by doing something that no one in this industry does, which is being herself.<|LINE_BREAK|>
This woman has surpassed all competition while still being the same girl from Barbados, surrounded by the same friends, speaking with the same accent and never missing a crop over unless it's to come and perform at OVO Fest. We love the music which can change styles from album to album. We love the videos which change their artistic vision from year to year. But most of all, we love the woman who hasn't changed since day one.<|LINE_BREAK|>
She's someone, she's someone I've been in love with since I was 22 years old. She's one of my... she's one of my best friends in the world. All my adult life I've looked up to her even though she's younger than me. She's a living, breathing legend in our industry. Ladies and gentlemen, the recipient of the Michael Jackson Vanguard Award for 2016: Rihanna.

I got a club in the Raptors arena<|LINE_BREAK|>
Championship celebrations durin' regular season<|LINE_BREAK|>
Paternity testin' for women that I never slept with<|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm legally obligated if they request it<|LINE_BREAK|>
So much legal action like I'm Michael Jackson<|LINE_BREAK|>
Luckily, I'm great at avoidin' distraction<|LINE_BREAK|>
Used to give no reaction, now I'm overreacting<|LINE_BREAK|>
Aw, nigga, that shit gotta go platinum<|LINE_BREAK|>
I just listened to "Closer to My Dreams"<|LINE_BREAK|>
Wide-eyed and uneducated at nineteen<|LINE_BREAK|>
I can't rap like that, all young and naïve<|LINE_BREAK|>
Not after all the shit I seen and the things I believe<|LINE_BREAK|>
Drastically changin', thank you for all your patience<|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm just in a different space and I choose to embrace it<|LINE_BREAK|>
Four thousand square feet just isn't as spacious<|LINE_BREAK|>
You loved me back in the basement, guess it is what we make it<|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm tired of awkward exchanges and niggas' crooked ways<|LINE_BREAK|>
Tired of champagne toasts with people that look away<|LINE_BREAK|>
Peyton and Eli when niggas called me they brother<|LINE_BREAK|>
The season start and I don't wanna see you end up with nothin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all throw the word "family" around too much in discussion<|LINE_BREAK|>
Rookie season, I would've never thought this was comin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
They knees give out and they passin' to you all of the sudden<|LINE_BREAK|>
Now you the one gettin' buckets<|LINE_BREAK|>
They put they arm around you, now you becomin' the crutches<|LINE_BREAK|>
Kids got on your number 'cause you the one they look up to<|LINE_BREAK|>
And women that you seen on TV look better in person<|LINE_BREAK|>
And either they wanna fuck you<|LINE_BREAK|>
Or convince you that they care and see where it goes from there, but<|LINE_BREAK|>
These ain't the girls from Brampton, this ain't that local action<|LINE_BREAK|>
The hate is just bringin' me and my people closer, actually<|LINE_BREAK|>
What happened to the things you niggas said was supposed to happen?<|LINE_BREAK|>
Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that it never happened?<|LINE_BREAK|>
We just supposed to get the pie, then split it in two?<|LINE_BREAK|>
Supposed to forget your mistakes, but not forget about you?<|LINE_BREAK|>
My plan was always to make the product jump off the shelf<|LINE_BREAK|>
And treat the money like secrets, keep the shit to ourself<|LINE_BREAK|>
Papi champú, young Pablito de seis dios<|LINE_BREAK|>
6 G-O-D, I think I<|LINE_BREAK|>
Was destined for this shit when I was 'round Keyshia Cole and T.I.<|LINE_BREAK|>
And Young Dro was poppin' off with "Ain't I"<|LINE_BREAK|>
Way before niggas had they hands out like they doin' macarena<|LINE_BREAK|>
But, who am I to complain now? I'm still around, they know<|LINE_BREAK|>

On my plate, lookin' up<|LINE_BREAK|>
Outer space, Pearly Gates

<|VERSE_BREAK|>

I'm runnin', but can't run away<|LINE_BREAK|>
You say you changed<|LINE_BREAK|>
But you never change up
 
<|endoftext|>
 

 
<|startoftext|>
 
Yeah<|LINE_BREAK|>
All you self-promoters are janky<|LINE_BREAK|>
We established like the Yankees<|LINE_BREAK|>
This whole fuckin' game thankless<|LINE_BREAK|>
We movin' militant but somehow you the one tankin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
No limit to where I can take it<|LINE_BREAK|>
And you know me as a Cris' bottle sender, check picker-upper<|LINE_BREAK|>
I thought we looked out for one another<|LINE_BREAK|>
Saw us all as brothers in the struggle, too blessed to be humble<|LINE_BREAK|>
I guess it's different in the city I come from<|LINE_BREAK|>
All the sudden I got people showing how much they truly resent me<|LINE_BREAK|>
They whole demeanor just spells envy, they tryna tempt me<|LINE_BREAK|>
The higher I get, the less they accept me<|LINE_BREAK|>
Even had the OG's tryna press me, ha-ha-ha, ha<|LINE_BREAK|>
No way out 'cause I'm already in it<|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm not attending when I do a show and get a ticket<|LINE_BREAK|>
Good business can clean millions, I got the vision<|LINE_BREAK|>
I been had it since "No Scrubs" and "No Pigeons"<|LINE_BREAK|>
Even back when I wasn't as poppin'<|LINE_BREAK|>
When they told me take an R&B nigga on the road<|LINE_BREAK|>
And I told 'em no and drew for Kendrick and Rocky<|LINE_BREAK|>
I tried to make the right choices with the world watching<|LINE_BREAK|>
"Mike never tried to rap like Pac, Pac never tried to sing like Mike"<|LINE_BREAK|>
Those my dad's words to me when I asked him how to make it in life<|LINE_BREAK|>
And I always said my mother gave the greatest advice, yeah<|LINE_BREAK|>
Look at me now, they look at me like the golden child<|LINE_BREAK|>
Can't nobody hold me down<|LINE_BREAK|>
Especially not right now<|LINE_BREAK|>
Certain shit is just too wild to reconcile<|LINE_BREAK|>
Take that, take that<|LINE_BREAK|>
No love in they heart so they fake that<|LINE_BREAK|>
DiCaprio level the way they play that<|LINE_BREAK|>
Damn, nigga, what is that?<|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all don't hear no songs<|LINE_BREAK|>
They hit my phone like, "You did that"<|LINE_BREAK|>
They even hit my line like, "Where you been at?"<|LINE_BREAK|>
It's always on some shit like<|LINE_BREAK|>
"When can I get a favor?" or, "Where my bitch at?"<|LINE_BREAK|>
Like I'm about to tell you where she been at<|LINE_BREAK|>
Costa Careyes, I got her kidnapped<|LINE_BREAK|>
She ain't sorry and I ain't sorry, it's too late for sorry<|LINE_BREAK|>
Green, white, and red on my body 'cause I'm dipped in Ferrari<|LINE_BREAK|>
All she wanna do is get high and listen to PARTY<|LINE_BREAK|>
She complain, I tell the driver to drop her at Barneys<|LINE_BREAK|>
My summer diet is just Rosé and calamari<|LINE_BREAK|>
Look, now you got me started<|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm the black sheep, rest in peace to Chris Farley<|LINE_BREAK|>
I got a lot to lose 'cause in every situation I'm the bigger artist<|LINE_BREAK|>
Always gotta play it smarter<|LINE_BREAK|>
Y'all shook up, I'm here on the cookup<|LINE_BREAK|>
Cameras pointing every time I look up<|LINE_BREAK|>
That's why I gotta duck behind Chubb's shoulder just to hit the kush up<|LINE_BREAK|>
Sponsorship dollars is sky high<|LINE_BREAK|>
He be like, "Drake, will you please stop smoking la-la?"<|LINE_BREAK|>
Chubbs, why try? I'm a thug, I'ma die high<|LINE_BREAK|>
Got the rose pink tinted lenses, it's a Wednesday<|LINE_BREAK|>
Architects takin' dimensions, they redoin' the entrance<|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, redoin' the entrance<|LINE_BREAK|>
Kinda like when you niggas drop on some again and again shit<|LINE_BREAK|>
And you still never quite get it<|LINE_BREAK|>
Meantime, Drizzy over there, tryna make you, make you dance to this<|LINE_BREAK|>
Yeah, I make you dance to this<|LINE_BREAK|>
I roll big body, wide body, Calabasas road winder<|LINE_BREAK|>
Sun shinin', waxed tires<|LINE_BREAK|>
See Kris Jenner, I beep twice and I wave<|LINE_BREAK|>
The rest of you boys, I blow Keeks right in your face<|LINE_BREAK|>
Pistol by my bed, I'm sleep, but I'm awake<|LINE_BREAK|>
For that one night when niggas try reach inside my safe<|LINE_BREAK|>
Don't push me 'cause I'm way too uneasy nowadays<|LINE_BREAK|>
These guys move so greezy nowadays<|LINE_BREAK|>
I tell you my life and y'all don't believe me when I say it<|LINE_BREAK|>
Save my stories for down the line<|LINE_BREAK|>
I'm too ahead of the curve every time<|LINE_BREAK|>
Just total the hits and see what you find, you SWV<|LINE_BREAK|>
'Cause you weak and I'm always, always on your mind

<|VERSE_BREAK|>

Yeah, and we can't stop<|LINE_BREAK|>
Make you dance to this, uh<|LINE_BREAK|>
